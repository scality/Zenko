Cloud Management Services
=========================

Zenko operates in the context of a Kubernetes cluster. This provides
numerous opportunities to interact with third-party systems for
monitoring and managing the cluster and the data Zenko manages there.

The following default Zenko services offer dashboard access to help you
understand whatâ€™s going on in your cluster:

-  `Kubernetes`_
-  `Grafana`_
-  `Cerebro`_
-  `Kibana`_

While these projects are independent of Zenko, and their operation
exceeds scope for this document, this section offers a description of
how to access them from Zenko.
