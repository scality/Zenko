Copy Owner ID
=============

The owner's Canonical ID is a 64-byte hash string that uniquely
identifies the owner. It can be useful for certain searches, and for
cross-account and cross-user access. Zenko provides an easy way to copy
this string.

#. In the Multicloud Browser window, open a bucket.

   transferred to the clipboard. The Zenko UI does not offer
   notification of this transfer.
