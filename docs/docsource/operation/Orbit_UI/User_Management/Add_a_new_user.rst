   Copy this key and store it.

   .. warning::

      You will not get a second chance to copy this key! If you lose the key, the
      user name and any information associated with it are lost as well.

   A **Copy** button is included in the user interface for your convenience.
   
As the Zenko user, you can create multiple users in the Zenko-managed namespace,
each with a unique access key and secret key. You can also re-generate 
access/secret key pairs for any such user.
