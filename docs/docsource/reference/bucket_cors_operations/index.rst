Bucket CORS Operations
======================

Bucket CORS operations enable Zenko to permit cross-origin requests sent
through the browser on a per-bucket basis. To enable cross-origin
requests, configure a S3 bucket by adding a CORS subresource containing
rules for the type of requests to permit.
