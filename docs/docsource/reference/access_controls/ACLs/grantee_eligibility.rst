Grantee Eligibility
===================

A grantee can be an account or one of the predefined groups. Permission
is granted to an account by the email address or the canonical user ID.
However, if an email address is provided in the grant request, Zenko finds the
canonical user ID for that account and adds it to the ACL. The resulting
ACLs always contain the canonical user ID for the account, not the
account’s email address.

AWS Canonical User ID
---------------------

Canonical user IDs are associated with AWS accounts. When an AWS account is
granted permissions by a grant request, a grant entry is added to the ACL with
that account’s canonical user ID.

Predefined Amazon S3 Groups
---------------------------

Zenko offers the use of Amazon S3 predefined groups. When granting account
access to such a group, specify one of URIs instead of a canonical user
ID.

.. note::

   When using ACLs, a grantee can be an AWS account or one of the
   predefined Amazon S3 groups. However, the grantee cannot be an Identity
   and Access Management (IAM) user. When granting AWS accounts access to
   resources, be aware that the AWS accounts can delegate their permissions
   to users under their accounts (a practice known as cross-account
   access).
