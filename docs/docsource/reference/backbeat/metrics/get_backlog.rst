.. _`get backlog`:

Get Backlog
===========

This route returns the replication backlog in number of objects and number of
total bytes for the specified extension type and location name. Replication
backlog represents the objects that have been queued for replication to another
location, but for which the replication task is not complete. If replication for
an object fails, failed object metrics are considered backlog.
