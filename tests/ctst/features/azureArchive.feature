    Scenario Outline: Archive objects when timeout is reached
    Given a "<versioningConfiguration>" bucket
    And a transition workflow to "e2e-azure-archive" location
    And <objectCount> objects "obj" of size <objectSize> bytes
    Then object "obj-1" should be "transitioning" and have the storage class "e2e-azure-archive"
    And object "obj-2" should be "transitioning" and have the storage class "e2e-azure-archive"
    And manifest containing object "obj-1" should "contain" object "obj-2"
    And manifest access tier should be valid for object "obj-1"
    And tar access tier should be valid for object "obj-1"

    Examples:
        | versioningConfiguration | objectCount | objectSize |
        |           Non versioned |           2 |        100 |
        |               Versioned |           2 |        100 |
        |               Suspended |           2 |        100 |
