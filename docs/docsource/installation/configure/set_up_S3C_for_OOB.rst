Setting Up Out-of-Band Updates for S3 Connector
===============================================

Zenko operates by establishing and managing a namespace of data. For select
object stores, Zenko does not have to create a namespace; rather, it can read an
existing namespace and use it as its own. This process of metadata ingestion
makes it easier to manage existing data stores, as Zenko can "go back in time"
and pick up the history of a namespace and assume management and replication
tasks retroactively. 

Prerequisites
-------------

The following are required to configure out-of-band updates for S3 Connector:

* An S3 bucket must be established on an S3 Connector (version 7.4.4 or
  later). See "Using the S3 Browser" in *S3 Connector Operation*.

* The S3 Connector bucket must have permissions that enable Zenko access.

* The S3 Connector bucket must have versioning enabled.

* The Zenko user must have access to an S3 Connector user credentials (an access
  key and a secret key) and the S3-credentialed user must have access to the
  target S3 bucket.

Establishing a Zenko user in S3 Connector with all and only necessary
permissions to access the bucket is considered a best practice. See "Create a
Zenko User for Out-of-Band Updates" in *S3 Connector Operation* for how to
assign correct policies to a Zenko user for S3 access.

There are no special Zenko dependencies for Zenko 1.1 or later. 

Set Up Out-of-Band Updates for S3 Connector
-------------------------------------------

#. Go to **Storage Locations** and click the "**Add New**" button.

   .. image:: ../Resources/Images/add_new_cloud_location.png
 
   #. Enter the name of the new storage location (this can be the same as or
      different than the bucket name) and select the **Scality RING with S3
      Connector** location type.

   #. Enter the access key and secret key pair you copied when creating the
      S3 Connector bucket. 

   #. Enter the target bucket name. The Target Bucket Name field requires
      conformity to Amazon S3 naming conventions (Lowercase alphanumerics
      only. Hyphens allowed. No punctuation or diacritical marks.) 

   #. In the Endpoint field, enter the endpoint's locator (URL or IP address),
      followed by the port number appropriate for the protocol. For HTTP
      (non-secure) use port 80, or omit the port assignment. For HTTPS, use port
      443. For diagnostic, familiarization, and test purposes, port 8000 is
      acceptable. This directly addresses the endpoint, but bypasses load
      balancers.

   #. Check the **Write objects without prefix** box. The warning text, "Storing
      multiple buckets in a location with this option enabled can lead to data
      loss" appears. This is expected. Click Save.

      .. image:: ../Resources/Images/add_new_location_dialog.*
         :width: 75%
         :align: center

   The new cloud location appears in the Cloud Locations window. The Mirroring
   indicator is grayed out.

   .. image:: ../Resources/Images/new_cloud_location.*

#. Open the Multicloud Browser and click **Create Bucket**.

   #. Enter the bucket name. 

   #. Select the appropriate Location Constraint. You will see two instances of
      the name of the storage location you created above. Pick the instance that
      is followed by "(Mirror mode)".

      .. image:: ../Resources/Images/create_bucket_mirror_mode.*

   #. Click **Create**.

   #. The Multicloud Browser view returns. 

      .. image:: ../Resources/Images/mirroring_enabled_indicator.*

      Note the icon at far right indicating metadata ingestion has been
      activated. In the **Cloud Locations** window, the **Mirroring** button is
      activated and no longer grayed out.

In a few minutes, objects stored in the S3 Connector become visible and
manageable from Zenko. Files uploaded to Zenko propagate to S3 Connector as
well.
