Registering Orbit to |product|

Orbit can be run as a user interface to |product| no matter where or how |product| is
hosted. You can deploy |product| on any host running Kubernetes 1.11.3 or
later. Successfully tested Kubernetes hosts include:

-  A test instance running on a local machine using Minikube
-  A cloud host using MetalK8s
-  A cloud host using the host’s native Kubernetes environment (EKS, GKE, AKS).
