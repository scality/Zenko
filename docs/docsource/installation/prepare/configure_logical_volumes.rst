Configuring Logical Volumes
===========================

Set up a cluster of nodes conforming to the specifications described in
:ref:`sizing`. If you are using MetalK8s, do this by downloading the latest
stable MetalK8s source code from the MetalK8s releases page:
https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/releases. Follow the instructions in
`MetalK8s Installation
<https://documentation.scality.com/metalk8s/2.4.2/installation/index.html>`_
to install MetalK8s on your cluster, instantiating the desired number of nodes.

.. note::

   It is a best practice to install Zenko on a fresh cluster.

.. _Minimum Volume Size for Cluster Deployments:

Minimum Volume Size for Cluster Deployments
-------------------------------------------

The following volume sizes are known good for a five-node cluster.

For each node, create one volume of each of the following sizes:

- 6 GB
- 10 GB
- 12 GB
- 22 GB
- 54 GB

One additional 100 GB volume for S3 data, which can be bound to any of the
nodes, is also required. For a five-node deployment, this totals five sets of
five volumes, plus the S3 data volume.

Custom Sizing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For custom sizing for a cluster or a "cluster of one" (single-server)
deployment, increase these base numbers. For non-MetalK8s deployments, follow
your vendor or communityâ€™s instructions for configuring persistent volumes at
500 GB/node.

.. _Create a Storage Class Manifest:

Create a Storage Class Manifest
-------------------------------

On the bootstrap node, add a storage class manifest corresponding to the
different volume sizes to be created on each node. This YAML file describes the
general properties that a given volume type will possess.

Define each storage class using the following parameters. The only setting that
deviates from the defaults is the metadata:name value. 

* **apiVersion:** Define this as ``storage.k8s.io/v1``
* **kind:** Define this as ``StorageClass``
* **metadata:** This field defines the name and labels associated with the
   storage node.
   
   * **name:** You can name a node whatever you want, but it's a good idea to
     keep things simple and name the node according to its size or anticipated
     function.
   * **labels:** Set this to ``zenko: storageclass`` taking care to indent as
     shown in the example.

* **mountOptions:** Set the ``mountOptions`` field to ``- rw`` and ``- discard``
  as shown in the example.
* **parameters:** This field defines the file system type and options. Set
  ``fstype`` to ``ext4`` and ``mkfsOptions`` to ``'["-m", "0"]'``, indenting as
  shown in the example.
* **provisioner:** Define this as ``kubernetes.io/no-provisioner``.
* **reclaimPolicy:** Define this as ``Retain``.
* **volumeBindingMode:** Define this as ``WaitForFirstConsumer``.

#. Create a storageclasses.yaml file based on the following example. For the
   sizing described in :ref:`Minimum Volume Size for Cluster Deployments`,
   you can copy, paste, and save this example.

   ::

    ---
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
      name: zenko-storage
      labels:
        zenko: storageclass
      annotations:
        storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
    mountOptions:
      - rw
      - discard
    parameters:
      fsType: ext4
      mkfsOptions: '["-m", "0"]'
    provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
    reclaimPolicy: Retain
    volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer

#. Run ``kubectl apply -f storageclasses.yaml`` to create the resources.

   ::
      
      storageclass.storage.k8s.io/zenko-storage created

#. Run ``kubectl get storageclasses`` to verify that the storage class definitions have
   been accepted.

   ::

      NAME                      PROVISIONER                    AGE
      metalk8s-prometheus       kubernetes.io/no-provisioner   80m
      zenko-storage (default)   kubernetes.io/no-provisioner   52s

Set Up Logical Volumes with MetalK8s
------------------------------------

Use the MetalK8s GUI to set volume sizes. You *must* size the volumes during
setup. The easiest way to do this is to set the volume sizes when creating them,
then to assign them as follows:

#. Open the MetalK8s Platform user interface at [bootstrap]:8443.

#. Click the **Nodes** tab.

#. Review the Nodes list for nodes in your cluster with a **Deploy** button
   available in the **Deployment** column. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy
   available nodes.

For each node,

#. Click the name of the node in the Platform menu to display node details.

   .. image:: ../Graphics/MK8s_node_select.png
      :width: 75%

#. Click the **Volumes** tab.

   .. image:: ../Graphics/MK8s_details.png
      :width: 50%

#. Click the **+** button.

   .. image:: ../Graphics/MK8s_volume_tab.png
      :width: 75%

#. The **Create a New Volume** window displays.

   .. image:: ../Graphics/MK8s_volume_create.png
      :width: 100%

#. Enter the volume's

   a. **Name** This must be AWS S3 compliant: lowercase letters, numbers, and
      hyphens only.
   #. **Labels** This is an optional, customizable key-value metadata pair for
      objects that pass through this volume.
   #. **Storage Class** This field contains a pull-down menu of the storage
      class options you created in the Storage Class Manifest
      (storageClasses.yaml) in :ref:`Create a Storage Class Manifest`.
   #. **Type** This presents two options: **RawBlockDevice** and
      **SparseLoopDevice**. The **SparseLoopDevice** option is intended for test
      environments only. Expect performance degradation if you select this option.      
   #. **Device Path**\/**Volume Capacity** If you selected a raw block device in
      the preceding step, enter the **Device path** to the volume. In a virtual
      environment this may be /dev/vda, /dev/sda, or similar. If you selected a
      sparse loop device in the preceding step, enter the **Volume Capacity**
      using a dimension and size, in binary exponent format (kibi, mebi,
      gibibyte, etc.)

      .. image:: ../Graphics/MK8s_volume_create_filled_in.png

#. Click **Create**. If you've correctly entered all information, a success
   banner displays and the new volume appears in the volumes menu.

   .. image:: ../Graphics/MK8s_volume_create_success.png

#. Open the MetalK8s Platform user interface at [bootstrap]:8443.

#. Click the **Nodes** tab.

#. Review the Nodes list for nodes in your cluster with a **Deploy** button
   available in the **Deployment** column. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy
   available nodes.
