.. _Upload Part - Copy:

Upload Part - Copy
==================

The Upload Part - Copy operation is used to upload a part by copying
data from an existing object as data source. The data source is
specified by adding the request header x-amz-copy-source to the request,
and a byte range is specified by adding the request header
x-amz-copy-source-range to the request.

The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB.

.. tip::

  Instead of using an existing object as part data, it is possible to use
  the Upload Part operation and provide data in the request. For more
  information, refer to :ref:`Upload Part`.

A multipart upload must be initiated before uploading any part. In
response to the initiate request, Zenko returns a unique identifier — the
*upload ID* — that must be included in the upload part request.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

The Upload Part-Copy operation does not use Request Parameters.

Headers
~~~~~~~

The Upload Part operation can use a number of optional request headers in
addition to those that are common to all operations (see :ref:`Common Request
Headers`).

The Upload Part - Copy operation does not return request elements.

Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~

If a bucket has versioning enabled, it is possible to have multiple versions of
the same object. By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the current version of
the object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker and a versionId is
not specified in the x-amz-copy-source, Zenko returns a 404 error, because the
object does not exist. If versionId is specified in the x-amz-copy-source and
the versionId is a delete marker, Zenko returns an HTTP 400 error, because a
delete marker cannot be specified as a version for the x-amz-copy-source.

Optionally, a specific version of the source object to copy can be specified by
adding the versionId subresource, as shown:

.. code::

   x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id

   Part boundaries are factored into ETag calculations, so if the part boundary
   on the source is different than on the destination, the ETag data between the
   two will not match. However, data integrity checks are performed with each
   copy to ensure that the data written to the destination matches the data at
   the source.

Examples
--------

PUT Request Uploading One Part of a Multipart Upload
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request A
`````````

The PUT request uploads a part (part number 2) in a multipart upload. The
request specifies a byte range from an existing object as the source of this
upload. The request includes the upload ID received in response to an
:ref:`Initiate Multipart Upload` request.

.. code::

   PUT /{{objectName}}?partNumber={{partNumber}}&amp;uploadId={{uploadId}} HTTP/1.1
   Host: {{BucketName}}.s3.scality.com
   x-amz-copy-source: /{{sourceBucket}}/{{sourceObject}}
   x-amz-copy-source-range:bytes={{first-Last}}
   x-amz-copy-source-if-match: {{etag}}
   x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match: {{etag}}
   x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since: {{timeStamp}}
   x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since: {{timeStamp}}
   Date: {{date}}
   Authorization: {{authorizationString}}

Response A
``````````

The response includes the ETag header, a required value for sending the
:ref:`Complete Multipart Upload` request.

.. code::

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   x-amz-id-2: Vvag1LuByRx9e6j5Onimru9pO4ZVKnJ2Qz7/C1NPcfTWAtRPfTaOFg==

   <ETag>"9b2cf535f27731c974343645a3985328"</ETag>
   </CopyPartResult>

Request B
`````````

The PUT request uploads a part (part number 2) in a multipart upload. The
request does not specify the optional byte range header, but requests the entire
source object copy as part 2. The request includes the upload ID received in
response to an :ref:`Initiate Multipart Upload` request.

.. code::

   PUT /newobject?partNumber=2&amp;uploadId=VCVsb2FkIElEIGZvciBlbZZpbmcncyBteS1tb3ZpZS5tMnRzIHVwbG9hZR HTTP/1.1
   Host: example-bucket.s3.scality.com
   Date:  Mon, 7 Nov 2016 20:34:56 GMT
   x-amz-copy-source: /source-bucket/sourceobject
   Authorization: {{authorizationString}}

Response B
``````````

The Request B response structure is similar to the one specified in Response A.

Request C
`````````

The PUT request uploads a part (part number 2) in a multipart upload. The
request specifies a specific version of the source object to copy by adding the
versionId subresource. The byte range requests 6 MB of data, starting with byte
500, as the part to be uploaded.

.. code::

   PUT /newobject?partNumber=2&amp;uploadId=VCVsb2FkIElEIGZvciBlbZZpbmcncyBteS1tb3ZpZS5tMnRzIHVwbG9hZR HTTP/1.1

The response includes the ETag header, a value required for sending the
:ref:`Complete Multipart Upload` request.
