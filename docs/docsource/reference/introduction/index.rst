API Basics
----------

Zenko operates by deploying and managing containerized instances of CloudServer,
a Scality service that reproduces relevant API calls from Amazon's Simple
Storage Service (S3) API. Using this RESTful API requires access credentials (an
access/secret key pair) in a well-formed request. The following sections
describe supported protocols and APIs, correct formatting for requests and
responses, possible error messages, and bucket encryption methods.
