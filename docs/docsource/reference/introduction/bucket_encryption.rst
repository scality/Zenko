Bucket Encryption
=================

Slightly different from AWS SSE, Zenko bucket encryption is transparent to the
application. Buckets are created with a special
x-amz-scal-server-side-encryption header (value: AES256), which specifies that
the bucket's objects be encrypted, and thereafter there is no need to change any
object PUT or GET calls in the application as the encrypt/decrypt behavior will
simply occur (encrypt on PUT, decrypt on GET). In contrast, AWS SSE can be quite
intrusive, as it requires special headers on all object-create calls, including
Object Put, Object Copy, Object Post, and Multi Part Upload requests.

Zenko bucket encryption is similar to SSE-C in its integration with a key
management service (KMS). Zenko requires users to provide the KMS, which
generates encryption keys on PUT calls and retrieves the same encryption key on
GET calls. Thus, Zenko does not store encryption keys.

Zenko also uses standard 256-bit OpenSSL encryption libraries to perform payload
encryption and decryption. This supports the Intel AES-NI CPU acceleration
library, making encryption nearly as fast as non-encrypted performance.
