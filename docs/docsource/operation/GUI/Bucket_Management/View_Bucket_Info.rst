From this panel, you can:

-  Review permissions and the bucket’s cross-region replication status
-  Copy the bucket’s Amazon Resource Name (**Copy Bucket ARN**)
-  Toggle the **Versioning** feature

For more information on versioning, review the Amazon S3 documentation
at: \ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html.
XDM implements S3 logic for versioning.
