Adding a Transient Source Storage Location
==========================================

Adding a transient source storage location is quite similar to adding
any other storage location, but for a few particulars.

A transient source location is a temporary buffer to which data is
stored and from which data is replicated. Only Scality RINGÂ with sproxyd
supports the transient source replication feature. Data written to the
transient source location can be replicated to any cloud service
supported by Zenko.

To deploy a transient source storage location:

#. Open Orbit to a registered Zenko instance:

#. Click **Add New Storage Location**.

#. Enter the **Location Name** and from the **Location Type** drop-down
   list, select **Scality RING with Sproxyd Connector**.

#. Enter the Location Details ( Bootstrap List, Proxy Path, and
   Replication Factor for Small Objects). Click **Advanced Options**,
   raising the Advanced Options pane.

#. To create a transient source you must check the **Delete objects
   after successful replication** option.You can also set the **Limit
   total size in this location to** parameter to a reasonable size that
   conforms to the anticipated size of files, peak demand, and estimated
   throughput of the slowest cloud to which you intend to replicate
   data.

#. Click **Save**. The transient source location is established.

#. Go to `Setting Up Replication`_, setting
   the transient source as the source bucket.

Do not update metadata in a transient source object. Changing metadata
of an object in a transient source bucket will fail. You cannot change
metadata in the S3 protocol.
