System Architecture
===================

Basics
------

Zenko provides a layer that mediates between a user or configured
storage frontend and one or several storage backends.

Zenko may use a transient source, which enables it to write once to a
master (local) storage cloud, then replicate the stored data to other
clouds without incurring egress fees from the primary storage cloud.

Zenko uses agile application frameworks such as Kubernetes for
orchestration and Prometheus for monitoring. Zenko is deployed using
Kubernetes either on-premises or remotely, or using a cloud Kubernetes
framework (such as GKE, AKS, EKS, or Kops). Scality supports MetalK8s
as the reference Kubernetes implementation for Zenko installations.

Zenko Services Stack
--------------------

The following diagram summarizes the Zenko cloud architecture:

.. image:: ../Resources/Images/Zenko_arch_NoNFS.*
   :align: center
 
The Zenko instance depicted above presents an idealized representation
of Zenko’s structure. Several complexities are elided for clarity.

Transient source replication is optional and configurable. Transient
source storage requires an on-premises RING deployment (with sproxyd).

The central square in this diagram represents the suite of
interdependent services required to implement a working Zenko instance.
Deployed, this suite of services is highly available, containerized, and
under the control of Kubernetes. Kubernetes dynamically creates and
destroys services in response to demand.

The following table offers brief descriptions of the Zenko components in
this architecture:

   | CloudServer        | CloudServer is an open-source Node.js implementation of |
   |                    | a server handling the Amazon S3 protocol. It presents   |
   |                    | the core logic for translating user inputs and data     |
   |                    | into stored objects on several cloud storage systems.   |
   |                    | With this component, users can create locations         |
   |                    | corresponding to different clouds.                      |

   |                    | event tracing (such as admin\_API, etc.) and job        |
   |                    | queuing for current actions (such as CRR, lifecycle     |
   |                    | management, synchronous encryption, etc).               |
   +--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
   | Orbit              | The Orbit UI offers users controls for CloudServer,     |
   |                    | workflow management, user management, and Metadata (MD) |
   |                    | instance configuration using such parameters as         |
   |                    | location, access key, workflow configuration (CRR, for  |
   |                    | example), basic search, etc.                            |

   |                    | explodes JSON values, allowing powerful searches and    |
   |                    | potentially indexing to speed up searches.              |
   +--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
   | Local RING/sproxyd | For local cloud storage (including transient source),   |
   |                    | S3 data can be put to an sproxyd RING.                  |

These services and their likely use cases are described in the sections
that follow.

Zenko Cluster Topology
----------------------

To operate with high availability, Zenko must operate on a cluster of at 
least three physical or virtual servers running CentOS 7.4 and either have
access to a virtual Kubernetes instance (EKM, GKM, or AKM) or to an instance 
of MetalK8s installed and running on each server.

When run in a cluster configuration, Zenko is highly available. Load
balancing, failover, and service management are handled dynamically in
real time by Kubernetes. This dramatically improves several aspects of
service management, creating a fast, robust, self-healing, flexible,
scalable system. From the user’s perspective, Zenko is functionally a
single instance that obscures the services and servers behind it.

   :align: center

A basic test configuration—a cluster of three servers—is depicted 
above. Five servers is the recommended minimum service deployment for
high availability. In actual practice, each server can dynamically 
deploy up to ten CloudServer instances, making for a default maximum of 
50 CloudServer instances, plus one master. Kubernetes sets the current
upper boundary, defined by the number of pods (including service
pods) that can be run, at 100 pods. The Zenko instance that manages all
these CloudServers spans all deployed and functioning servers, managing
a common namespace of data and associated metadata, with Kubernetes
managing individual servers, spinning services up and down in response
to emergent conditions.
