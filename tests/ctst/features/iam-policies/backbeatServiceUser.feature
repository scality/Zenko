Feature: IAM Policies for Backbeat Service Users
  As a backbeat service user, 
  I want to have specific permissions to perform S3 actions for data replication and expiration 
  So that I can effectively manage data within the system.

  Scenario Outline: Backbeat Service Users are authorized to perform the actions and get success response
    Given an existing bucket "" "<withVersioning>" versioning, "without" ObjectLock "" retention mode
    And an object "" that "<objectExists>"
    And a service user "<serviceUserName>" assuming the role "<roleName>" of a user account
    When the user tries to perform "<action>" on the bucket
    Then the user should be able to perform successfully the "<action>" action

    Examples:
      | action               | withVersioning | objectExists   | serviceUserName         | roleName                    |
