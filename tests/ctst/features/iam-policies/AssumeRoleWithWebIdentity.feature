  Scenario Outline: Assume Role with Web Identity
    Given an existing bucket "" "<withVersioning>" versioning, "without" ObjectLock "without" retention mode
    And an object "" that "<objectExists>"
    And a <type> type
    When the user tries to perform "<action>" on the bucket
    Then the user should be able to perform successfully the "<action>" action

    Examples:
      | action                          | type                  | withVersioning | objectExists   |

  Scenario Outline: Data Consumer with Web Identity cannot perform these bucket actions
    Given an existing bucket "" "<withVersioning>" versioning, "without" ObjectLock "without" retention mode
    And an object "" that "<objectExists>"
    And a DATA_CONSUMER type
    When the user tries to perform "<action>" on the bucket
    Then the user should receive "AccessDenied" error

    Examples:
      | action              | withVersioning | objectExists   |
      | CreateBucket        | with           | does not exist |
      | DeleteBucket        | with           | does not exist |
      | PutBucketVersioning | with           | does not exist |
