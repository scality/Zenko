Prometheus
==========

Prometheus is a systems and service monitoring system produced as an
open-source project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It
collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates
rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if a
condition is observed to be true.

Prometheus offers Kubernetes-native support for discovering services and
metrics. Its primary use in Zenko is to gather monitoring data from
Zenko services, nodes, and clusters. This information is then sent to
Grafana for dashboard-style display.
