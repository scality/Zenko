Prometheus
==========

One of several dashboards available to Zenko users, Prometheus provides insight
into Kubernetes platform (MetalK8s) and Zenko functionality.

Lifecycle Metrics
-----------------

The lifecycle transition policies feature generates useful metrics, currently
exposed through SoundCloud's Prometheus toolkit. Exposure through the Backbeat
API is under development.

The following Prometheus metrics are available (see the _`Prometheus 
documentation<https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/>`
to access counter/gauge/histogram data and how to query the Prometheus API).
Labels and their content are described below.

Available Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**zenko_replication_queued_total**

  - type: counter
  - description: number of objects queued for replication
  - labels: origin, partition, fromLocation, fromLocationType, toLocation, 
    toLocationType

**zenko_replication_queued_bytes**

  - type: counter
  - description: number of bytes queued for replication
  - labels: origin, partition, fromLocation, fromLocationType, toLocation, 
    toLocationType

**zenko_replication_processed_bytes**

  - type: counter
  - description: number of bytes replicated
  - labels: origin, fromLocation, fromLocationType, toLocation, toLocationType,
    status

**zenko_replication_elapsed_seconds**

  - type: histogram
  - description: replication jobs elapsed time in seconds
  - labels: origin, fromLocation, fromLocationType, toLocation, toLocationType,
    status, contentLengthRange

The following labels are provided to one or more of the above metrics:

  - **origin:** The "origin" label identifies the service that triggered the 
    replication, e.g. “lifecycle”. Currently, lifecycle is the  only service
    to use replication as reflected in these metrics, but when other services 
    under development use it, this label will be used to distinguish replication
    tasks by the services triggering them.

  - **partition:** The partition number in the “backbeat-data-mover” Kafka topic
    where the replication task has been queued.

  - **fromLocation:** The name of the source Zenko location 

  - **fromLocationType:** This identifies the type of location from which the 
    “fromLocation” call emerged: “aws_s3” for an AWS compatible location, 
    “local” for a local storage location or a RING location, “azure” for an Azure
    location, “gcp” for a Google Cloud location. 

  - **toLocation:** The name of the target Zenko location

  - **toLocationType:** This identifies the type of location to which the information
    in “toLocation” is targeted. This follows the convention described in 
    **fromLocation**

  - **status:** This reports the status of the finished task: “success”
    if the replication completed successfully or “error” if it did not.

  - **contentLengthRange:** This range separates the metric values in different
    content-length (object size) buckets to offer more meaningful elapsed 
    time metrics grouped by object size ranges. The labels used are: “<10KB”,
    “10KB..30KB”, 30KB..100KB”, […], “300GB..1TB”, “>1TB”.

Kafka Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kafka provides its own set of Prometheus metrics. One, kafka_consumergroup_lag,
is especially useful for monitoring lifecycle transitions:

**kafka_consumergroup_lag**

  - type: counter

  - description: Lag of consumer groups on a topic/partition,
    i.e. number of messages published but not consumed yet by this
    consumer group

  - labels: topic, partition, consumergroup

  The following labels can be used to filter this metric:

  - **topic:** The topic name. The relevant topic names for transition policies
    are:

    - “backbeat-data-mover” for tracking the data mover (replication) topic

    - “backbeat-lifecycle-bucket-tasks” for tracking the bucket tasks
      topic (scanning buckets for lifecycle actions to execute on objects)

    - “backbeat-lifecycle-object-tasks” for tracking the object tasks
      topic (tasks to execute on each expiration or a transition object)

    - “backbeat-gc” for tracking the garbage collection topic (The garbage 
      collection service removes original data after a transition. It is also
      used for transient source data removal after successful CRR.)

  - **partition:** Partition number in the Kafka topic

  - **consumergroup:** This label carries the consumer group name. Relevant 
    consumer group names for transition policies are:

    - backbeat-replication-group-[location name]: Consumer group
      that consumes replication tasks of transition actions to a
      particular location (e.g. “backbeat-replication-group-aws1”
      tracks the consumer group for the "aws1" location). Consumer groups
      will also consume messages for other locations, but will not process 
      them (hence the lag will also count replications to other locations).

    - backbeat-lifecycle-bucket-processor-group: The unique consumer
      group of the “backbeat-lifecycle-bucket-tasks” topic.

    - backbeat-lifecycle-object-processor-group: The unique consumer
      group of the “backbeat-lifecycle-object-tasks” topic.

    - backbeat-gc-consumer-group: The unique consumer group of the
      “backbeat-gc” topic

You can use either the Prometheus API or the Prometheus UI and the PromQL 
query language to access these metrics.

Below is an example. See the Prometheus documentation for a full PromQL
reference. 

  - Compute the total average throughput, in bytes per second, of
    successful replications triggered by lifecycle transitions over
    the last 5 minutes::

      sum(rate(zenko_replication_processed_bytes{origin="lifecycle",status=”success”}[5m]))

The foregoing descriptions are not encyclopedic. You may find other 
metrics not documented here to be suitable for your use case.
