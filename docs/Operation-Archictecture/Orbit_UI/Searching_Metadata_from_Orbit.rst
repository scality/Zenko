Searching Metadata from Orbit
=============================

Every file stored in an object storage system is associated with a set
of metadata. Understanding the metadata tags associated with these files
provides a powerful method for extremely fast search and retrieval of
files.

Orbit provides a graphical tool for performing metadata searches, the
syntax for which is hinted under the search bar itself, but also
described explicitly in `Searching Metadata with Zenko`_.

To search the metadata of files stored in clouds managed by Zenko ,

#. Click Search in the navigation pane.

Clicking the arrow icon next to the searchg result takes you to the
item’s location in the bucket.
