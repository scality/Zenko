Zenko Operation
===============

Zenko is Scality’s multi-cloud storage controller. It provides a single
point of integration, using the Amazon S3 cloud storage API, and enables
backup, transfer, or data replication across private and public clouds.

Using Zenko, you can store to a Scality RING storage device, and
automatically back up to one or several public clouds. Alternatively,
you can use a public cloud such as Amazon S3 as a primary storage and
replicate data stored there—specific files, file types, or entire
buckets—to other supported clouds, such as Google Cloud Platform
(GCP) or Microsoft Azure.
