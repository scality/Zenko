Object Lifecycle Management
===========================

Cloud users can apply lifecycle rules (specified in Amazon’s `AWS S3 API
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html>`__) to buckets
managed through Zenko. These rules are triggered after a defined time has passed
since the object’s last modification. Zenko supports expiration and transition
of objects when a defined number of days has passed since those objects’
creation. This enables automated deletion or movement of older objects.

Installation
------------

Lifecycle management is part of Backbeat configuration and is installed
with Backbeat. It is enabled by default, and can be disabled in the Zenko
deployment configuration files.

Operation
---------

Lifecycle management conforms partially to the S3 lifecycle management syntax
described at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html.
Zenko lifecycle management supports expiration and transition actions. Files
that exceed a preconfigured temporal threshold (for example, 90 days) are
expired and deleted from the bucket in which they are stored or transitioned and
moved.

Bucket lifecycle characteristics inhere to the bucket: Zenko’s lifecycle
management feature does not set lifecycle characteristics, but does
enforce them. When lifecycle management is enabled, the host cloud
enforces buckets’ lifecycle rules. If CRR operation is enabled, Zenko
replicates the lifecycle event to all backup clouds.

To configure bucket lifecycle, follow the AWS S3 Lifecycle Configuration
Element syntax described in
`https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html>`__.

.. note:: To implement the S3 API effectively in a cross-cloud context, Zenko
   interprets S3's ``<StorageClass>`` field differently from how AWS defines
   it. Where Amazon uses StorageClass to indicate various proprietary Amazon
   storage locations that can be described by their quality of service, Zenko
   uses this parameter to identify cloud service locations by a user-defined
   name. So, instead of using ``<StorageClass>GLACIER<\StorageClass>`` for
   inexpensive, high-latency storage, the Zenko user must define a cloud
   location with satisfactory storage and pricing requirements and use that
   cloud location as the target cloud storage location. Zenko reads and writes
   to this location based on the StorageClass tag definition.

Zenko API Calls
---------------

The Zenko API provides three calls to manage lifecycle properties per
bucket:

-  PUT Bucket Lifecycle
-  GET Bucket Lifecycle
-  DELETE Bucket Lifecycle

   .. tip::
   
      See the `AWS S3 API Reference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketOps.html>`__
      for protocol-level formatting details.

These calls manage bucket attributes related to lifecycle behavior,
which are stored as part of bucket metadata.

Managing Lifecycle Rules from the S3 API 
----------------------------------------

See `https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html 
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html>`__
for more examples and explanations on lifecycle rules.

#. Create a JSON file defining the bucket lifecycle rules (see
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/set-lifecycle-cli.html
   for examples).

   .. note::

      The “Rules” section is an array that can hold multiple
      rules.

#. Use the aws s3api to set the JSON lifecycle rule on a bucket,
   zenko-bucket.

   ::

       $ aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket zenko-bucket --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle_config.json

   You can confirm that the rule has been set with:

   ::

       $ aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket zenko-bucket

Once the lifecycle rules on the bucket are set, the rules apply to all
objects in the specified bucket.

.. _Lifecycle Queries:

Querying Lifecycle Events
-------------------------

You can access the storage location of transitioned object data by
viewing the object's metadata, for example by making a HEAD request.

Querying the CloudServer requires an active kubectl session with the
Zenko controller and S3 API functionality configured as described in
:ref:`S3 API config`. Once this is configured, use the head-object command
as described in
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/head-object.html.

For example:

.. code::
   
   $ aws s3api head-object --bucket <bucket-name> --key <key-name> --endpoint <endpoint-url>

returns:

.. code::

   {
      "AcceptRanges": "bytes",
      "ContentType": "application/octet-stream",
      "LastModified": "Tue, 16 Apr 2019 22:12:33 GMT",
      "ContentLength": 1,
      "ETag": "\"e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e\"",
      "StorageClass": "aws-storage-location",
      "Metadata": {}
   }

The returned information describes the <key-name> object in the <bucket-name>
bucket. The StorageClass information indicates the object has transitioned to
a storage location named "aws-storage-location", as defined by the Zenko user.

After an expiration event, the object is deleted, and no metadata can be
queried. The object metadata is not found.
