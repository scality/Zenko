    # Scenario: CreateBucket with ACL
    #     When I create a bucket with an ACL where users are identified by email address

    # Scenario: Check Authentication with Vault
    #     Given a bucket "<withVersioning>" versioning, "<withRetention>" retention mode, "<withBucketAclViaCanonicalId>" ACL set via canonical ID
    #     And an object that "<objectExists>" "<withObjectAclViaCanonicalId>" ACL set via canonical ID
    #     When I perform "<action>" on an object "<withAclViaHeader>" ACL set via header
    #     Then I should pass Vault authentication

    #     Examples:
    #         | action                 | withVersioning | withRetention | withBucketAclViaCanonicalId | objectExists   | withObjectAclViaCanonicalId | withAclViaHeader |
