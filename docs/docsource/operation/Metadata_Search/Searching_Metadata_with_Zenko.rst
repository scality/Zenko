Searching Metadata with Zenko
=============================

A successful request to Zenko requires

If these requirements are satisfied, you can perform metadata searches
by

-  Entering a search in the Orbit Search tool from an authorized session.
   See `Searching Metadata from Orbit`_.
-  Using the ``search_bucket`` tool (found in the
   `Scality/S3 <https://github.com/scality/S3>`__ GitHub repository) as
   described in `Using search_bucket`_.
-  Making an Auth V4-signed HTTP request to Zenko as described in
   `HTTP Search Requests`_.
