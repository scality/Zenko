Settings
========

The Settings window provides information on the Zenko instance (its name, ID, 
edition, version and last-modified date), and personal information, such as
whether you want to receive news updates, as well as a link to Scality Support
for data retrieval or account deletion.

The Settings window also provides a button, **Unlink this Zenko Instance**,
which offers to forget the Zenko instance. This option does not delete the
Zenko instance; rather, it breaks the association between Orbit and the
instance. If you click this and confirm (**Forget**), you will not lose data
or otherwise perturb the running Zenko instance, but you will have to follow
the steps in :ref:`Setting Up a Full Orbit Installation <setting_up_orbit>`
to connect Orbit to another Zenko instance or reconnect it to the forgotten
instance.
