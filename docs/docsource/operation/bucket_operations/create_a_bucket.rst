#. Enter the bucket name and select the storage location. These values define
   the bucket and are irrevocable.

   .. note::
      
      The bucket name must be unique in the account, and must conform to AWS
      naming conventions: no capital letters or spaces are allowed, and the only
      permitted punctuation mark is the hyphen.

   .. note::

      If you cannot select the correct storage location, stop. Verify that you
      have selected the correct account; then follow the instructions for
      :ref:`Add a Storage Location` to set up the correct location before you
      continue.

#. The new bucket appears in the data browser view.
