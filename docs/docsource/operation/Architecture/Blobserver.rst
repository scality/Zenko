Blobserver
==========

Blobserver is an open-source Node.js object storage interpreter built to handle
Azure Blob Storage protocols. BlobServer provides an Azure Blob Storage API
interface to access object data stores across multiple backends, on-premises or
in the cloud, as well as translation for Azure Blob actions that interoperate
with S3 logic through CloudServer.

Blobserver has not achieved feature parity with CloudServer as of XDM version
|version|.
