CRR Metrics and Healthcheck
===========================

If source and destination buckets are set up to allow replication, when
a new object is added to the source bucket, the request for replicating
that object begins processing.

Metrics are gathered when entries are published to Kafka. When a Kafka
entry has completed processing and an object has replicated to its
destination bucket, further metrics are gathered to record its
completion.

Routes
------

The internal routes presented in the following table are required for
testing the overall health of Backbeat and to measure the progress of an
ongoing replication.

All metric routes contain a {{location-name}} variable.

The site name must match the name specified in
env\_replication\_endpoints under the backbeat replication
configurations in env/client\_template/group\_vars/all.

If the site is for a different cloud backend (i.e. AWS, Azure), use that
backend’s defined type (aws\_s3 or azure, for example).

To show all metrics for all sites, set {{location-name}} to “all”.

Replication Status
------------------

A special status, PROCESSING, supports cross-region replication with a
multiple-backend topology. Objects in CRR buckets transition from PENDING to
PROCESSING to COMPLETED or FAILED.

**ReplicationStatus**

-  PENDING: CRR to all backends is pending.
-  PROCESSING: At least one backend has completed and is waiting for
   other backend(s) to finish.
-  COMPLETED: All backends report a completed status.
-  FAILED: At least one backend failed.

Each backend’s replication status is reported as user metadata.

For example, if the site names configured in the replication endpoints
are aws-backend-1, aws-backend-2, azure-backend-1, and azure-backend-2,
user metadata on the head object may appear as:

::

    aws-backend-1-replication-status: COMPLETED
    aws-backend-2-replication-status: PENDING
    azure-backend-1-replication-status: COMPLETED
    azure-backend-2-replication-status: PENDING

This user metadata is in addition to the object’s replication status,
which follows the logic laid out in the bucket config file.

Health Check Details
--------------------

Backbeat health checks return an array of three key:value objects. The
keys are:

-  A number (a numeric key)
-  ``metadata``
-  ``internalConnections``

Each numeric key contains as its value an object containing nodeId, host, and
port key objects. The numeric keys represent each ZooKeeper node and its
details.

::

    zookeeperNode: {
        nodeId: <value>,
        host: <value>,
        port: <value>
    }

One of these key:value objects is key-named “metadata.” Its value is an object
containing key:value pairs where each key represents a ZooKeeper node, and each
value holds details on topic name, partition number, leader number, replicas,
and in-sync replicas (ISRs) per partition.

::

    metadata: {
        zookeeperNode: {
            topic: <value>,
            partition: <value>,
            leader: <value>
            replicas: <value>
            isr: <value>
        }
    }

The internalConnections object key nominates an object consisting of three keys:

-  ``isrHealth``, which carries a value of either ``ok`` or ``error``.
-  ``zookeeper``, which shows a status and status details (see
   https://github.com/alexguan/node-zookeeper-client#state for more
   detail).
-  ``kafkaProducer``, which carries a value of either ``ok`` or
   ``error``, and checks the health of all Producers for every topic.

::

    internalConnections: {
        isrHealth: <ok || error>,
        zookeeper: {
            status: <ok || error>,
            details: {
                name: <value>,
                code: <value>
            }
        },
        kafkaProducer: {
            Status: <ok || error>
        }
    }
