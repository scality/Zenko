### Requirements
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/#installation) v0.25
  - [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm#install) v2.8.2
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

The following assumes you have minikube (which requires virtualbox or other virtualization options),
kubectl, and helm installed (see links above). Once minikube, kubectl, and helm are installed,
start minikube with at least version 1.9 of kubernetes and perferably with 4GB of RAM (although the
default value of 2GB should work, we recommend 4GB or more) and enable the minikube ingress addon for communication.
#### NOTE the listed versions are known to be working properly as some edge release versions may have issues properly deploying
```shell
$ minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.9.0 --memory 4096
$ minikube addons enable ingress
```
###### For installations requiring Role Based Access Control see [RBAC](#installation-using-rbac)

Once minikube has started, run the helm initialization.
```
$ helm init --wait
```
#### Older versions of helm may not work with the --wait flag

Clone the repo and go into the charts directory
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/scality/Zenko.git
$ cd ./Zenko/charts
```

Once you have the repo cloned you can retrieve all dependencies:

```shell
$ helm repo add incubator http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator
"incubator" has been added to your repositories

$ helm dependency build zenko/

...Successfully got an update from the "stable" chart repository

```

With your dependencies built, you can run the following shell command to deploy a single node zenko stack with orbit enabled.
```shell
$ helm install --name zenko \
  --set prometheus.rbac.create=false \
  --set zenko-queue.rbac.enabled=false \
  --set redis-ha.rbac.create=false \
  -f single-node-values.yml zenko
```
#### NOTE that Orbit is enabled by default with these values

To view the Kubernetes dashboard type the following and will launch the dashboard in your default browser:
```shell
$ minikube dashboard
```
#### NOTE that once you helm install, it may take several minutes for all the pods to load and stabilize

The endpoint can now be accessed via the kubernetes cluster ip (run
```minikube ip``` to display the cluster ip). As mentioned above, Orbit remote
management is enabled for your minikube deployment, so you may now
[register your instance](../docs/orbit_registration.md).

## Testing your deployment

To test your minikube deployment, please refer to our client configuration guide,
from our CloudServer documentation. By default, minikube only exposes SSL port
443, so you'll want to ask your client/app to use SSL. However, since minikube
uses a self-signed certificate, you may get security error. You can either
configure minikube to use a trusted certificate, or simply ignore the
certificate.

> NOTE: In this example, we alias a "domain name" to the minikube IP; we
> recommend doing this as it avoids using IPs directly for further configuration
> (e.g.: Orbit endpoint configuration), which leads to typo-like mistakes more
> often than human-readable aliases/domain names.

See the example below:

```shell
$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.1.1   machine

192.168.99.100 minikube

$ cat ~/.s3cfg
[default]
access_key = OZN3QAFKIS7K90YTLYP4
secret_key = 1Tix1ZbvzDtckDZLlSAr4+4AOzxRGsOtQduV297p
host_base = minikube
host_bucket = %(bucket).minikube
signature_v2 = False
use_https = True

$ s3cmd ls  --no-check-certificate

$
```

If you get an empty response to your first list, it means communication went
through properly with Zenko hosted in minikube.
To perform more complex operations, you will need to configure your Zenko
cluster; to do so, the easiest is to
[register your instance](../docs/orbit_registation.md) on Orbit.
If you get errors, please reach out on the [forum](https://forum.zenko.io/).

## Installation Using RBAC
Some users might prefer testing with Role Based Access Control for development purposes and to
test features that are often enabled in production environments. To run a minikube environment
with RBAC enabled

```shell
$ minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.9.0 --memory 4096 --extra config=apiserver.Authorization.Mode=RBAC

$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding add-on-cluster-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller

$ helm init --service-account tiller --wait
```

Clone the repo and go into the charts directory
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/scality/Zenko.git
$ cd ./Zenko/charts
```

Once you have the repo cloned you can retrieve all dependencies:
```shell
$ helm repo add incubator http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator
"incubator" has been added to your repositories

$ helm dependency build zenko/
