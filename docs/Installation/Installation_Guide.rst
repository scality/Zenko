Installation Guide
==================

While it is possible to run Zenko on a single machine, it's designed for
cluster operation. If you can set up a Kubernetes cluster on your own, review
the **General Cluster Requirements** and skip to **Installing Zenko**, below.

Otherwise, you can set up a cluster quickly using MetalK8s_, Scality's
open-source Kubernetes cluster project, as described in "Setting Up a Metal K8s
Cluster," below.

The following section describes general cluster requirements, which are tested
on Metal K8s. Because MetalK8s is designed to operate without support from
public cloud resources, the following sizing requirements are assumed good for
other cloud Kubernetes deployments, where such resources are preinstalled and
available on demand.

Setting Up a Cluster
####################

General Cluster Requirements
****************************

Setting up a testing cluster requires at least three machines (these can be
VMs) running CentOS_ 7.4 or higher (The recommended mimimum for Zenko
production service is five server nodes with three masters/etcds, but for
testing and familiarization, three masters and three nodes is fine). You must
have SSH access to these machines and they must have SSH access to each other.

Each machine acting as a Kubernetes_ node must also have at least one disk
available to provision storage volumes.

Once you have set up a cluster, you cannot change the size of the machines on
it.

Sizing
======

The following sizes for Zenko instances have been tested on live systems using
MetalK8s, which adds some overhead. If you are running a different Kubernetes
engine, fewer resources may be required, but such configurations remain to be
tested.

Reserve the following resources for each node.

-  Cores per server

   - 24 vCPU minimum
   - 32 vCPU medium load
   - 58 vCPU heavy load

-  RAM per server

   - 32 GB minimum
   - 64 GB medium load
   - 96 GB heavy load

-  Additional resources
   - 120 GB SSD (boot drive)
   - 80 GB SSD

-  Storage

   -  1 TB persistent volume per node minimum


      .. Note::

        This requirement is for storage, not for the system device. Storage
        requirements depend on the sizing of different components and
        anticipated use. You may have to attach a separate storage volume to
        each cloud server instance.

All servers must run CentOS 7.4 or later, and must be ssh-accessible.

Custom Sizing
=============

The default persistent volume sizing requirements are sufficient for a
conventional deployment. Your requirements may vary, based on total data
managed and total number of objects managed.

.. Important::

   Persistent volume storage  must match or exceed the maximum
   anticipated demand. Once set, the cluster cannot be resized
   without redefining new volumes.

To size your deployment, review the default values in
Zenko/kubernetes/zenko/values.yaml. This file reserves space for each component
in the build. This is the baseline build, which Helm will install unless
instructed otherwise.

Next, review the values discussed in Zenko/kubernetes/zenko/storage.yaml.
The storage.yaml file contains sizing instructions and settings that, when
specified in a Helm installation, override the default values expressed in the
values.yaml file. To override default values using storage.yaml, use the
following addendum to the helm install invocation at Zenko deployment.

``
$ helm install [other options] -f storage.yaml
``

How much persistent volume space is required is calculable based on total data
managed, total objects managed, and other factors. See storage.yaml for details.

Proxies
=======

If you are behind a proxy, add the following lines to your local machine’s
/etc/environment file:

::

    http_proxy=http://user;pass@<my-ip>:<my-port>
    https_proxy=http://user;pass@<my-ip>:<my-port>
    no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,10.*

Installing Zenko
################

Set up a cluster of five nodes conforming to the specifications listed above.
If you are using MetalK8s, do this by downloading the latest stable MetalK8s
source code from the MetalK8s releases page:
https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/releases. Follow the Quickstart guide
(in docs/usage/quickstart.rst) to install MetalK8s on your cluster.

When building your cluster, take sizing into account. If you are deploying
non-default sizing, make sure your volume sizing is sufficient. For MetalK8s,
you *must* size the volumes in the inventory during setup in
metalk8s/inventory/group_vars/kube-node.yml.

For a default sizing, paste the following into kube-node.yml:

.. code-block:: yaml
		
  metalk8s_lvm_default_vg: False
  metalk8s_lvm_vgs: ['vg_metalk8s']
  metalk8s_lvm_drives_vg_metalk8s: ['/dev/vdb']
  metalk8s_lvm_lvs_vg_metalk8s:
    lv01:
      size: 125G
    lv02:
      size: 125G
    lv03:
      size: 125G
    lv04:
      size: 62G
    lv05:
      size: 62G

For custom sizing, increase these base numbers.

For non-MetalK8s deployments, follow your vendo or community’s instructions for
configuring persistent voloumes at 500 Gi/node.

.. note::

   It is a best practice to install Zenko on a fresh cluster.


Get Ready
*********

.. note ::

   It is a best practice to install Zenko on a fresh cluster.

1. If you are using MetalK8s, use the MetalK8s virtual shell. Change to the
   directory from which you will deploy Zenko:
   ::

    $ cd

   If you are not installing from MetalK8s, follow the instructions in
   Zenko/docs/gke.md to install Helm on your cluster.

2. Initialize Helm:
   ::

    (metal-k8s) [centos@node01 ~]$ helm init
    Creating /home/centos/.helm
    Creating /home/centos/.helm/repository
    Creating /home/centos/.helm/repository/cache
    Creating /home/centos/.helm/repository/local
    Creating /home/centos/.helm/plugins
    Creating /home/centos/.helm/starters
    Creating /home/centos/.helm/cache/archive
    Creating /home/centos/.helm/repository/repositories.yaml
    Adding stable repo with URL: https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
    Adding local repo with URL: http://127.0.0.1:8879/charts
    $HELM_HOME has been configured at /home/centos/.helm.
    Warning: Tiller is already installed in the cluster.
    (Use --client-only to suppress this message, or --upgrade to upgrade Tiller to the current version.)
    Happy Helming!
    (metal-k8s) [centos@node01 ~]$

   Helm can now install applications on the Kubernetes cluster.

3. Clone the latest Zenko version:
   ::

    $ git clone https://github.com/scality/Zenko.git
    Cloning into 'Zenko'...
    remote: Counting objects: 4335, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
    remote: Total 4335 (delta 1), reused 4 (delta 0), pack-reused 4325
    Receiving objects: 100% (4335/4335), 1.25 MiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (2841/2841), done.

Install Zenko
*************

Helm installs Zenko using packages of Kubernetes resource definitions known as
charts. These charts, which Helm follows for each Zenko component, can be found
under zenko/kubernetes/zenko/charts. For each component there is a Chart.yaml
file and a values.yaml file. Helm reads the Chart.yaml file to establish such
basic installation attributes as name and version number, and reads the values
file for instructions on how to deploy and configure the component. Though
manually editing the default settings in values.yaml is possible, it is much
better to write configuration changes and options to
:file:`zenko/kubernetes/zenko/options.yml`, which Helm can use to
overwrite the default settings presented in the charts.

Follow these steps to install Zenko with Ingress.

.. Note::

   The following example is for a configuration using the NGINX ingress
   controller. If you are using a different ingress controller, substitute
   parameters as appropriate.

1. Create an options.yml file in Zenko/kubernetes/ to store deployment
   parameters. Enter the following parameters:
   ::

    ingress:
      enabled: "true"
      annotations:
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 0
      hosts:
        - zenko.local

    cloudserver:
      endpoint: "zenko.local"

   You can edit these parameters, using each component’s values.yaml file
   as your guide. Save this file.

2. To configure the ingress controller for HTTPS, go to
   “:doc:`configure_ingress`” for additional terms to add to this chart.

3. If your Zenko instance is behind a proxy, add the following lines to the
   options.yml file, entering your proxy’s IP addresses and port assignments:
   ::

    cloudserver:
      proxy:
        http: ""
        https: ""
        caCert: false
        no_proxy: ""

   If the HTTP proxy endpoint is set and the HTTPS one is not, the HTTP proxy
   will be used for HTTPS traffic as well.

.. note::

    To avoid unexpected behavior, only specify one of the "http" or
    "https" proxy options.

4. Perform the following Helm installation from the kubernetes directory
   ::

    $ helm install --name my-zenko -f options.yml zenko

   If the command is successful, the output from Helm is extensive.

5. To see K8s’s progress creating pods for Zenko, the command:
   ::

    $ kubectl get pods -n default -o wide

   This returns a snapshot of pod creation. For a few minutes after the
   Helm install, some pods will show CrashLoopBackOff issues. This is
   expected behavior, because there is no launch order between pods.
   After a few minutes, all pods will enter Running mode.

6. To register your Zenko instance for Orbit access, get your
   CloudServer’s name
   ::

    $ kubectl get -n default pods | grep cloudserver
    my-zenko-cloudserver-76f657695-j25wq              1/1   Running   0       3m
    my-zenko-cloudserver-manager-c76d6f96f-qrb9d      1/1   Running   0       3m

   Then grab your CloudServer’s logs with the command:
   ::

     $ kubectl logs my-zenko-cloudserver-<id> | grep 'Instance ID'


   Using the present sample values, this command returns:
   ::

     $ kubectl logs my-zenko-cloudserver-76f657695-j25wq | grep 'Instance ID'

     {"name":"S3","time":1532632170292,"req_id":"effb63b7e94aa902711d",\
     "level":"info","message":"this deployment's Instance ID is \
     7586e994-01f3-4b41-b223-beb4bcf6fff6","hostname":"my-zenko-cloudserver-\
     76f657695-j25wq","pid":19}

   Copy the instance ID.

7. Open https://admin.zenko.io/user in a web browser. You may be prompted to
   authenticate through Google.

8. Click the **Register My Instance** button.

9. Paste the instance ID into the Instance ID dialog. Name the instance what
   you will.

Your instance is registered.
