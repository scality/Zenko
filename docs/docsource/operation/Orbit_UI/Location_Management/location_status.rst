Location Status
===============

The **Location Status** button on the Orbit sidebar opens the Location
Status window. 

.. image:: ../../Resources/Images/Orbit_Screencaps/location_status.png

This provides a "high view" of the cloud locations under Zenko's management.
From the Location Status window, you can see which locations are configured,
each location's type and operating status, and the amount of data stored at
that location.

No management tasks are accessible from the Location Status window. It is
informative only.
