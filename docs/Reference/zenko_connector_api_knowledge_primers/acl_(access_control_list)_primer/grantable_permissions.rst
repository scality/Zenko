+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

.. note::

  The set of ACL permissions is the same for object ACL and bucket ACL.
  However, depending on the context (bucket ACL or object ACL), these ACL
  permissions grant permissions for specific bucket or the object
  operations.
