Installation Guide
==================

While it is possible to run Zenko on a single machine, itâ€™s designed for
cluster operation. If you can set up a Kubernetes cluster on your own,
review the :ref:`General Cluster Requirements` and skip to
:ref:`Installing Zenko`.

Otherwise, you can set up a cluster quickly using
`MetalK8s <https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/>`__, Scality's open-source
Kubernetes cluster project, as described in "`Setting Up a MetalK8s Cluster`_".
