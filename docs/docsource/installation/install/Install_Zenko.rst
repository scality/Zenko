.. _Install_Zenko:

Install Zenko
=============

Helm installs Zenko using packages of Kubernetes resource definitions known as
charts. These charts, which Helm follows for each Zenko component, can be found
under zenko/kubernetes/zenko/charts. For each component there is a Chart.yaml
file and a values.yaml file. Helm reads the Chart.yaml file to establish such
basic installation attributes as name and version number, and reads the values
file for instructions on how to deploy and configure the component. Though
manually editing the default settings in values.yaml is possible, it is much
better to write configuration changes and options to
zenko/kubernetes/zenko/options.yaml, which Helm can use to overwrite the default
settings presented in the charts.

Follow these steps to install Zenko with ingress.

.. note::

   The following example is for a configuration using the NGINX ingress
   controller. If you are using a different ingress controller, substitute
   parameters as appropriate.

.. _create_options.yaml:

1. Create an options.yaml file in Zenko/kubernetes/ to store deployment
   parameters. Enter the following parameters:
   ::

    ingress:
      enabled: "true"
      annotations:
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 0
      hosts:
        - zenko.local

    cloudserver:
      endpoint: "zenko.local"

   You can edit these parameters using each component’s values.yaml file
   as your guide. Save this file.

2. To configure the ingress controller for HTTPS, go to
   “:ref:`configure_ingress`” for additional terms to add to this chart.

3. If your Zenko instance is behind a proxy, add the following lines to the
   options.yaml file:

   ::

    cloudserver:
      proxy:
        http: ""
        https: ""
        caCert: false
        no_proxy: ""

   Enter your proxy’s full server address, including the protocol and port.

   For example: 

   ::

    cloudserver:
      proxy:
        http: "http://proxy.example.com:80"
        https: ""
        caCert: false
        no_proxy: "localhost,127.0.0.1,10.*"

   If the HTTP proxy endpoint is set and the HTTPS one is not, the HTTP proxy
   will be used for HTTPS traffic as well.

   .. note::

      To avoid unexpected behavior, specify only one of the
      "http" or "https" proxy options.


4. Perform the following Helm installation from the kubernetes directory
   ::

    $ helm install --name my-zenko -f options.yaml zenko

   If the command is successful, the output from Helm is extensive.

   .. note::
      
      The installation name must consist solely of alphanumeric characters
      and hypens. The name must start with an alphabetic character, and can
      end with alphabetic or numeric characters. Punctuation marks, including
      periods, are not permitted. 

5. To see Kubernetes's progress creating pods for Zenko, the command:
   ::

    $ kubectl get pods -n default -o wide

   returns a snapshot of pod creation. For a few minutes after the
   Helm install, some pods will show CrashLoopBackOff issues. This is
   expected behavior, because there is no launch order between pods.
   After a few minutes, all pods will enter Running mode.


6. To register your Zenko instance for Orbit access, get your
   CloudServer’s name:
   ::

     $ kubectl get -n default pods | grep cloudserver-manager

     my-zenko-cloudserver-manager-76f657695-j25wq      1/1   Running   0       3m

   Then grab your CloudServer’s logs with the command:
   ::

     $ kubectl logs my-zenko-cloudserver-manager-<id> | grep 'Instance ID'


   Using the present sample values, this command returns:
   ::

     $ kubectl logs my-zenko-cloudserver-manager-76f657695-j25wq | grep 'Instance ID'

     {"name":"S3","time":1532632170292,"req_id":"effb63b7e94aa902711d",\
     "level":"info","message":"this deployment's Instance ID is \
     7586e994-01f3-4b41-b223-beb4bcf6fff6","hostname":"my-zenko-cloudserver-\
     76f657695-j25wq","pid":19}

   Copy the instance ID.

7. Open https://admin.zenko.io/user in a web browser. You may be prompted to
   authenticate through Google.

8. Click the **Register My Instance** button.

9. Paste the instance ID into the Instance ID dialog. Name the instance what
   you will.

Your instance is registered.
