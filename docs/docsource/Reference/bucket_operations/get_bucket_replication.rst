   |                          | this directive to define a location by quality |
   |                          | of service (e.g., STANDARD or GLACIER), Zenko  | 
   |                          | uses it to direct replication to a location.   |
   |                          | The quality of service is determined and the   | 
   |			      |	replication destination is configured by the   |

**Retrieve Replication Configuration Information**

*Request Sample*

The following example GET request retrieves replication configuration
information set for the examplebucket bucket.

.. code::

   GET /?replication HTTP/1.1
   Host: examplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com
   x-amz-date: Tue, 10 Feb 2015 00:17:21 GMT
   Authorization: signatureValue

The following sample response shows that replication is enabled on the
bucket, and the empty prefix indicates that Zenko will replicate all
objects created in the examplebucket bucket. The Destination element
shows the target bucket where Zenko creates the object replicas and the
storage class (AzureCloud) that Zenko uses when creating replicas.

Zenko assumes the specified role to replicate objects on behalf of the
bucket owner.
