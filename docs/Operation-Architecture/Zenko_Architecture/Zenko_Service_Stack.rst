Zenko Services Stack
====================

The following diagram summarizes the Zenko cloud architecture:

The Zenko instance depicted above presents an idealized representation
of Zenko’s structure. Several complexities are elided for clarity.

Both transient source and NFS implementations are Transient source
replication is optional and configurable. Transient source storage
requires an on-premises RING deployment (with sproxyd). Implementing
 NFS interpretation requires deploying a Scality RING storage system. If
NFS is not implemented, a RING can be considered a private cloud.

The central square in this diagram represents the suite of
interdependent services required to implement a working Zenko instance.
Deployed, this suite of services is highly available, containerized, and
under the control of Kubernetes. Kubernetes dynamically creates and
destroys services to meet demands.

The following table offers brief descriptions of the Zenko components in
this architecture:

+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Component          | Description                                             |
+====================+=========================================================+
| CloudServer        | CloudServer is an open-source Node.js implementation of |
|                    | a server handling the Amazon S3 protocol. It presents   |
|                    | the core logic for translating user inputs and data     |
|                    | into stored objects on several cloud storage systems.   |
|                    | With this component, users can create locations         |
|                    | corresponding to different clouds.                      |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Backbeat           | Backbeat manages the queues involved in Zenko cloud     |
|                    | event tracing (such as admin\_API, etc.) and job        |
|                    | queuing for current actions (such as CRR, lifecycle     |
|                    | management, synchronous encryption, etc).               |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Orbit              | The Orbit UI offers users controls for CloudServer,     |
|                    | workflow management, user management, and Metadata (MD) |
|                    | instance configuration using such parameters as         |
|                    | location, access key, workflow configuration (CRR, for  |
|                    | example), basic search, etc.                            |
|                    |                                                         |
|                    | The UI runs in the cloud and is hosted by Scality.      |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| CLI                | CloudServer accepts commands from command-line          |
|                    | interfaces.                                             |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| MongoDB            | An open-source metadata database, MongoDB works with    |
|                    | one or multiple instances in scale-out mode. It also    |
|                    | explodes JSON values, allowing powerful searches and    |
|                    | potentially indexing to speed up searches.              |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Local RING/sproxyd | For local cloud storage (including transient source),   |
|                    | S3 data can be put to an sproxyd RING.                  |
