.. _Adding a Transient Source Storage Location:

Adding a Transient Source Storage Location
==========================================

Adding a transient source storage location is quite similar to adding any other
storage location, but for a few particulars.

A transient source location is a temporary buffer to which data is stored and
from which data is replicated. Scality RING with sproxyd is the only
production-ready environment that supports the transient source replication
feature (the Zenko Local environment also supports this feature, but is suitable
for testing purposes only). Data written to the transient source location can be
replicated to any cloud service Zenko supports.

To deploy a transient source storage location:

#. Click the **Storage Locations** button in the sidebar.

#. The **Cloud Locations** window displays. Click **Add New**.

#. The **Add New Storage Location** modal appears. Enter the **Location Name**
   and from the **Location Type** drop-down list, select **Scality RING with
   Sproxyd Connector**.

#. Enter the **Location Details** (**Bootstrap List**, **Proxy Path**,
   and **Replication Factor for Small Objects**). Click **Advanced Options**,
   raising the **Advanced Options**.

#. To create a transient source, check the **Delete objects after
   successful replication** option. You can also set the **Limit total
   size in this location to** parameter to a reasonable size that
   conforms to the anticipated size of files, peak demand, and
   estimated throughput of the slowest cloud to which you intend to
   replicate data.

#. Click **Save**. The transient source location is established.

#. Go to `Set Up Replication`_, setting
   the transient source as the source bucket.

Do not update metadata in a transient source object. Changing metadata
of an object in a transient source bucket will fail. You cannot change
metadata in the S3 protocol.
