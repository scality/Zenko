# Install Zenko On Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine

Zenko can be installed on a cluster managed on Google Cloud (GKE).
Start a new cluster on Kubernetes following the instructions on [Google
Cloud
documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart).

To run Zenko you'll need a cluster with 3 nodes, 2vCPU and 7.5GB RAM
each. Once the cluster is running, connect to it and install Helm on
it.

## Create Role For Tiller

Google Kubernetes Engine requires Role Based Access Control to be
setup. The first step is to create a `serviceaccount` for `tiller`:

```shell
$ kubectl create serviceaccount tiller --namespace kube-system
```

## Install Helm on GKE Cluster

Strangely, Helm is not available by default on GKE and needs to be
installed.

```shell
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get > get_helm.sh
$ bash ./get_helm.sh
```

Once that's completed, start Helm:

```shell
$ helm init --service-account tiller --wait
```
## Install Zenko

Clone Zenko's repo and go into the charts directory:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/scality/Zenko.git
$ cd ./Zenko/charts
```

Once you have the repo cloned you can retrieve all dependencies:

```shell
$ helm repo add incubator http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator
"incubator" has been added to your repositories

$ helm dependency build zenko/
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...

With your dependencies built, you can run the following shell command
to deploy a single node Zenko stack with Orbit enabled.


```shell
$ helm install --name zenko -f single-node-values.yml zenko
```
## Connect GKE Zenko To Orbit

Find the `Instance ID` to use for [registering your
instance](../docs/orbit_registration.md):

```shell
$ kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods --no-headers=true -o \
custom-columns=:metadata.name | grep cloudserver-front) | grep \
Instance | tail -n 1
```

The output will look something like this:

```
{"name":"S3","time":1529101607249,"req_id":"9089628bad40b9a255fd","level":"info","message":"this deployment's Instance ID is 6075357a-b08d-419e-9af8-cc9f391ca8e2","hostname":"zenko-cloudserver-front-f74d8c48c-dt6fc","pid":23}
```
