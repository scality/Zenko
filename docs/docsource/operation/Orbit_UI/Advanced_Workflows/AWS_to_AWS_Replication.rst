AWS-to-AWS Replication
======================

#. Create a bucket on AWS (https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/) with
   versioning enabled

#. From Orbit, open **Storage Location**, click **Add New** and enter
   information (location name, type, and type-specific options) for the AWS
   bucket you just created.

#. From the Multicloud Browser, create another bucket and set the new AWS
   location as its location constraint.

   If using AWS CLI, set the endpoint as the Zenko deployment, and location
   constraint as the AWS location.

#. The bucket created through Zenko appears in the drop-down menu on the **Set
   up bucket replication** dialog box.

   Replication`.
