HTTP Protocols
==============

Zenko Enterprise uses HTTP protocols as defined by RFC 2616. REST operations consist of
sending HTTP requests to Zenko, which returns HTTP responses. These HTTP
requests contain a request method, a URI with an optional query string,
headers, and a body. The responses contain status codes, headers, and
may contain a response body.

S3 supports the REST API, accessed via requests that employ an XML-based
protocol. Input parameters are provided as an XML body (at the Service
level) or as an XML array of entities (such as Buckets, Accounts or
Users), plus a time range (start and end times expressed as UTC epoch
timestamps). Output is delivered as an XML array, one element per
entity. Bytes transferred and number of operations metrics are
accumulated between the provided start and end times. For storage
capacity, discrete values are returned in bytes for the start and the
end times (not as an average between start and end).

Because request headers and response headers can be specific to a
particular Zenko API operation or set of operations, many such elements are
common to all operations.

Request headers that are typically found in Zenko requests include
Authorization, Content-Length, Content-Type, Date, and Host.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Header                            | Description                       |
+===================================+===================================+
| Authorization                     | Contains the information required |
|                                   | for authentication.               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Content-Length                    | Message Length (without headers), |
|                                   | as specified by RFC 2616;         |
|                                   | required for PUT and operations   |
|                                   | that load XML, such as logging    |
|                                   | and ACLs.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Content-Type                      | Resource content type (e.g.,      |
|                                   | text/plain) (For PUT operations,  |
|                                   | default is binary/octet-stream,   |
|                                   | and valid values are MIME types.) |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Date                              | Date and time of the request      |
|                                   | (default format is Thu, 31 Mar    |
|                                   | 2016 13:00:00 GMT, which conforms |
|                                   | to RFC 2616 Section 3.3.1).       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Host                              | Required for HTTP 1.1, the Host   |
|                                   | header points to the standard     |
|                                   | storage service. If the host      |
|                                   | contains anything other than the  |
|                                   | standard Zenko storage server,    |
|                                   | this information is interpreted   |
|                                   | as the bucket for the request.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Host header contains either   |
|                                   | the service host name or the      |
|                                   | virtual host                      |
|                                   | (bucket.s3.bsedomain.com), in     |
|                                   | addition to the bucket.           |
