Architecture
============

This section describes Zenko's system architecture and its software components.

Basics
------

Zenko provides a layer that mediates between a user or configured
storage frontend and one or several storage backends.

Zenko may use a transient source, which enables it to write once to a
master (local) storage cloud, then replicate the stored data to other
clouds without incurring egress fees from the primary storage cloud.

Zenko uses agile application frameworks such as Kubernetes for
orchestration and Prometheus for monitoring. Zenko is deployed using
Kubernetes either on-premises or remotely, or using a cloud Kubernetes
framework (such as GKE, AKS, EKS, or Kops). Scality supports MetalK8s
as the reference Kubernetes implementation for Zenko installations.

Zenko Services Stack
--------------------

The following diagram summarizes the Zenko cloud architecture:

.. image:: ../Graphics/Zenko_arch_NoNFS.*
   :align: center
 
The Zenko instance depicted above presents an idealized representation
of Zenko’s structure. Several complexities are elided for clarity.

Transient source replication is optional and configurable. Transient
source storage requires an on-premises RING deployment (with sproxyd).

The central square in this diagram represents the suite of
interdependent services required to implement a working Zenko instance.
Deployed, this suite of services is highly available, containerized, and
under the control of Kubernetes. Kubernetes dynamically creates and
destroys services in response to demand.

The following table offers brief descriptions of the Zenko components in
this architecture:

   | CloudServer        | CloudServer is an open-source Node.js implementation of |
   |                    | a server handling the Amazon S3 protocol. It presents   |
   |                    | the core logic for translating user inputs and data     |
   |                    | into object storage on several cloud storage systems.   |
   |                    | With this component, users can create locations         |

   |                    | protocol. It is functionally analogous to CloudServer   |
   |                    | in that it provides logic to translate user inputs and  |
   |                    | data into Azure Blob-compatible object storage. This    |

Service and Component Architecture
----------------------------------

Zenko consists of the following stateful and stateless services.

Stateful Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the following stateful services, each node has a copy of its object
data. Though their terminology varies, each service employs the same strategy
for maintaining availability. A primary service acts on data and transfers it to
replica instances on the other nodes. If the service running as the primary
fails (either due to internal error or node failure), the remaining replica
services elect a primary to continue. If this occurs on a three-node cluster, no
data is lost unless two nodes fail. On a five-node cluster, no data is lost
unless three nodes fail.

If a replica node fails, the primary continues operation without interruption
or an election.

The following stateful services conform to this failover strategy:

  * MongoDB
  * Redis
  * Kafka
  * ZooKeeper

Stateless Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following stateless services are based on a transactional model. If a
service fails, Kubernetes automatically reschedules the process on an available
node.

**Lifecycle Services**

  * Lifecycle Bucket Processor
  * Lifecycle Conductor
  * Lifecycle Object Processor
  * Garbage Collection (GC) Consumer

**Replication Services**

  * Replication Data Processor
  * Replication Populator
  * Replication Status Processor

**APIs**

  * CloudServer API
  * Backbeat API

**Monitoring Services**

  * Prometheus
  * Grafana

**Out-of-Band Services**

  * Ingestion Consumer
  * Ingestion Producer
  * Cosmos Operator
  * Cosmos Scheduler

**Orbit Management Layer**

  * CloudServer Manager


Zenko Cluster Topology
----------------------

To operate with high availability, Zenko must operate on a cluster of at least
three physical or virtual servers running Kubernetes |min_kubernetes| or
later. Run in such a cluster configuration, Zenko is highly available: load
balancing, failover, and service management are handled dynamically in real time
by Kubernetes. This dramatically improves several aspects of service management,
creating a fast, robust, self-healing, flexible, scalable system. From the
user’s perspective, Zenko is functionally a single instance that obscures the
services and servers behind it.

.. image:: ../Graphics/Zenko_cluster_NoNFS.*
   :align: center

A basic test configuration—a cluster of three servers—is depicted 
above. Five servers is the recommended minimum service deployment for
high availability. In actual practice, each server can dynamically
deploy up to ten CloudServer instances, making for a default maximum of 
50 CloudServer instances, plus one master. Kubernetes sets the current
upper boundary, defined by the number of pods (including service
pods) that can be run, at 100 pods. The Zenko instance that manages all
these CloudServers spans all deployed and functioning servers, managing
a common namespace of data and associated metadata, with Kubernetes
managing individual servers, spinning services up and down in response
to emergent conditions.

These services and their likely use cases are described in the sections
that follow.
