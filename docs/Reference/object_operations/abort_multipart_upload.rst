.. _Abort Multipart Upload:

Abort Multipart Upload
======================

The Abort Multipart Upload operation is used to cancel a multipart
upload (the upload ID for the affected object must be supplied). Once
initiated, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID.

.. tip::

  In the event of an Abort Multipart Upload operation, the storage
  consumed by any previously uploaded parts is freed. However, any partial
  uploads currently in progress may or may not succeed. Therefore,
  aborting a given multipart upload multiple times may be required to
  completely free all storage consumed by all upload parts. To verify that
  all parts have been removed, call the List Parts operation to ensure the
  parts list is empty.
