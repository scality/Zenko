Zenko Helm Chart
================

This is a [Helm] Chart for [Scality]'s [Zenko] multi-cloud controller. To get
started, you'll need a [Kubernetes] cluster, initialized with Helm. Check out
[minikube](./minikube.md) for a local or single-machine deployment.

First, retrieve all dependencies:

```console
$ helm repo add incubator http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator
"incubator" has been added to your repositories

$ helm dependency build zenko/
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...

```

**Note:** In released versions of Zenko and the Chart, these upstream charts
are embedded in the package created by `helm package`.

Then, assuming you have an ingress controller running, run something like:

```shell
$ helm install --name zenko --set ingress.enabled=true \
--set ingress.hosts[0]=zenko.local \
--set cloudserver.endpoint=zenko.local zenko
```

You can disable integration with the [Orbit] management UI (enabled by default).

See `values.yml` for more options.

To disable Orbit, use:

```shell
--set cloudserver.orbit.enabled=false
```

If a custom Orbit endpoint is required, use:

```shell
--set cloudserver.orbit.endpoint=https://custom.orbit.endpoint
--set cloudserver.orbit.pushEndpoint=https://custom.push.orbit.endpoint
```

and if `poll` mode is needed, use:
```shell
--set cloudserver.orbit.mode=poll
```

**Note:** `poll` mode should only be used when long-lived websocket connections
are not available. In `poll` mode:

+ `orbit.pushEndpoint` setting will be ignored
+ Interactive features such as Multicloud Browser, Metadata Search, CRR object
  status and CRR object retry will not be available
+ Configuration updates may take up to a minute to propagate
+ Statistics reports are sent less frequently

Autoscaling
-----------

This chart can be configured to deploy a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` for
`cloudserver`. This is disabled by default.

To set up autoscaling based on CPU consumption, configure the amount of CPU a
single `cloudserver` Pod requests. For example, to request one CPU to be
allocated:

```shell
--set cloudserver.resources.requests.cpu=1
```

Next, enable autoscaling using:

```shell
--set cloudserver.autoscaling.enabled=true
```

This scales up (and down) between 1 and 16 replicas, with 80% CPU
consumption as the per-Pod target.

These defaults can be modified using:

```shell
--set cloudserver.autoscaling.config.minReplicas=...
--set cloudserver.autoscaling.config.maxReplicas==...
--set cloudserver.autoscaling.config.targetCPUUtilizationPercentage=...
```

Prometheus Monitoring
---------------------

[Prometheus] is deployed as part of this stack. To access its built-in web UI,
create an `Ingress` object. To do so automatically, use something like

```shell
--set prometheus.server.ingress.enabled=true --set prometheus.server.ingress.hosts[0]=prometheus.local
```

Validating Your Deployment
--------------------------

A test suite is shipped with the Zenko Chart to help you run validation tests on
your deployment. Invoke this suite by running:

```shell
$ helm test $RELEASE_NAME --cleanup
```

where `$RELEASE_NAME` is replaced by the name you picked for the Helm release;
`zenko` in the example above.

Upgrading Your Deployment
-------------------------

To upgrade an existing Zenko installation to the latest version or simply change deployment
configuration, you will need to run the following commands. This assumes that your release
name is `zenko` and that you have previously cloned the repository. 

```shell
$ cd Zenko/charts
$ git pull
$ helm dependency build ./zenko
$ helm upgrade zenko ./zenko
```

You may want to run an upgrade simulation, something highly recommended in production environments. 
For example: 

```shell
$ helm upgrade zenko ./zenko --dry-run --debug
```

**Note:** In a production environment you may want to take neccessary additional steps to validate
the upgrade before proceeding with the upgrade. Running the upgrade with the `--dry-run` flag will
simulate and try to validate a compatible upgrade. Running with the `--debug` will output all the
templated values and deployment configurations that will be installed. These are just basic validations
but upgrade implications should be fully taken into account by you and/or your Kubernetes administrator.
