Bucket CORS Operations
======================

Bucket CORS operations enable Zenko to permit cross-origin requests sent
through the browser on a per-bucket basis. To enable cross-origin
requests, configure an S3 bucket by adding a CORS subresource containing
rules for the type of requests to permit.

.. _Bucket CORS Specification:

Bucket CORS Specification
-------------------------

Zenko implements the `AWS S3 Bucket CORS APIs <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html>`__.

Preflight CORS Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A preflight request with the HTTP OPTIONS method can be made against Zenko to
determine whether CORS requests are permitted on a bucket before sending
the actual request. (For detailed information on the preflight request
and response, see the `OPTIONS
object <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTOPTIONSobject.html>`__.)

.. warning::

  If several rules are specified, the first one matching the preflight
  request Origin, Access-Control-Request-Method header and
  Access-Control-Request-Headers header is the rule used to determine
  response headers that are relevant to CORS (the same behavior as AWS).

CORS Headers in Non-Options Requests and AWS Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the exception Access-Control-Allow-Headers, CORS-relevant response
headers are sent in response to regular API calls if those requests
possess the Origin header and are permitted by a CORS configuration on
the bucket.

.. note::

   Because responding with CORS headers requires making a call to metadata to
   retrieve the bucketâ€™s CORS configuration, CORS headers are not returned if
   the request encounters an error before the API method retrieves the bucket
   from metadata (if, for example, a request is not properly authenticated).
   Such behavior deviates slightly from AWS, in favor of performance,
   anticipating that the preflight OPTIONS route will serve most client needs
   regarding CORS. If many rules are specified, the first rule that matches the
   request's origin and HTTP method is used to determine response headers that
   are relevant to CORS (the same behavior as AWS).
