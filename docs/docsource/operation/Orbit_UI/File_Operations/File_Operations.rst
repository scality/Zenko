File Operations
===============

**Prerequisites:** You must have at least one account, containing at
least one bucket.

For each file stored in a Zenko bucket, you can view info, manipulate
tags and metadata, download the file to your local machine, or delete
the file from the bucket.

To access these operations:

#. Click **Browser** in the sidebar to open the **Multicloud Browser**.
#. Double-click the bucket you want to access.

   -  If the bucket is empty, Zenko asks you to **Drag and Drop
      Objects**:

      Clicking **Upload Objects** takes you to your local machine’s file
      system to pick files to upgrade. Clicking **skip** takes you to the
      empty bucket.

   -  Otherwise, the Multicloud Browser displays the bucket’s contents:

For each file, you can Download_, `View Info`_, or Delete_.
