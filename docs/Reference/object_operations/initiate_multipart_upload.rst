.. _Initiate Multipart Upload:

Initiate Multipart Upload
=========================

The Initiate Multipart Upload operation returns an ``upload ID`` that is
used to associate all the parts in the specific Multipart Upload. The
upload ID is specified in each subsequent upload part request (refer to
:ref:`Upload Part`), and it is also included in the final request
to either complete or abort the Multipart Upload request.

For request signing, Multipart Upload is just a series of regular
requests. First, multipart upload is initiated, then one or more
requests to upload parts is sent, and finally multipart upload
completes. Each request is individually signed (there is nothing special
about signing Multipart Upload requests).

.. tip::

  Any metadata that is to be stored along with the final multipart object
  should be included in the headers of the Initiate Multipart Upload
  request.

Requests
--------

**Request Syntax**

.. code::

   POST /{{ObjectName}}?uploads HTTP/1.1
   Host: {{BucketName}}.{{StorageService}}.com
   Date: {{date}}
   Authorization: {{authorizationString}}

**Request Parameters**

The Initiate Multipart Upload operation does not use Request Parameters.

**Request Headers**

The Initiate Multipart Upload operation can use a number of optional
request headers in addition to those that are common to all operations
(refer to :ref:`Common Request Headers`).

Access control-related headers can be used with this operation. By
default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full control. When
adding a new object, it is possible to grant permissions to individual
accounts or predefined groups. These permissions are then used to create
the Access Control List (ACL) on the object.

*Specifying a Canned ACL*

Zenko Enterprise supports a set of canned ACLs, each of which has a predefined set of
grantees and permissions.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

*Explicitly Specifying Access Permissions*

A set of headers is available for explicitly granting access permissions
to specific accounts or groups, each of which maps to specific Zenko Enterprise
permissions Zenko Enterprise supports in an ACL.

In the header value, specify a list of grantees who get the specific
permission.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Header                | Type                  | Description           |

Each grantee is specified as a ``type=value`` pair, where the type can
be any one of the following:

-  ``emailAddress`` (if value specified is the email address of an
   account)
-  ``id`` (if value specified is the canonical user ID of an account)
-  ``uri`` (if granting permission to a predefined group)

For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants list objects
permission to the accounts identified by their email addresses:

.. code::

   x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@scality.com", emailAddress="abc@scality.com"
