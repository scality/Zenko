.. _ACL (Access Control List):

ACL (Access Control List)
=========================

Access Control Lists (ACLs) enable the management of access to buckets
and objects.

Each bucket and object has an ACL attached to it as a subresource,
defining which accounts or groups are granted access and the type of
access. When a request is received against a resource, Zenko checks the
corresponding ACL to verify the requester has the necessary access
permissions.

When a bucket or object is created, Zenko creates a default ACL that grants
the resource owner full control over the resource as shown in the
following sample bucket ACL (the default object ACL has the same
structure).

.. code::

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <AccessControlPolicy xmlns="http://s3.scality.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
     <Owner>
       <ID>*** Owner-Canonical-User-ID ***</ID>
       <DisplayName>owner-display-name</DisplayName>
     </Owner>
     <AccessControlList>
       <Grant>
         <Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                  xsi:type="Canonical User">
           <ID>*** Owner-Canonical-User-ID ***</ID>
           <DisplayName>display-name</DisplayName>
         </Grantee>
         <Permission>FULL_CONTROL</Permission>
       </Grant>
     </AccessControlList>
   </AccessControlPolicy>

The sample ACL includes an Owner element identifying the owner via the
accountâ€™s canonical user ID. The Grantelement identifies the grantee
(either a specific account or a predefined group), and the permission
granted. This default ACL has one Grantelement for the owner. You grant
permissions by adding Grantelements, each grant identifying the grantee
and the permission.
