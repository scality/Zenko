Zenko is  [Scality](http://www.scality.com/)â€™s open source multi-cloud data
controller.

Zenko provides a unified namespace, access API, and search capabilities for
data stored locally (using Docker volumes or Scality RING) or in public cloud
storage services like [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3),
[Microsoft Azure Blob storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/),
or [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/).

## Overview

This repository includes installation resources to deploy the full Zenko
stack over different orchestration systems.

Currently we have [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and
[Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).

### Zenko Stack

The stack consists of:
- [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)
- [Zenko Cloudserver](https://github.com/scality/S3)
- [Zenko Backbeat Async Replication Engine](https://github.com/scality/backbeat)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [redis](https://redis.io/)

all configured to talk to each other.
