From this panel, you can:

-  Review permissions and the bucket’s cross-region replication status
-  Copy the bucket’s Amazon Resource Name (**Copy Bucket ARN**)
-  Toggle the **Versioning** feature

For more information on versioning, review the Amazon S3 documentation

Zenko implements S3 logic for versioning.
