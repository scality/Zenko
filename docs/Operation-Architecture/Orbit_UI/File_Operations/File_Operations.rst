File Operations
===============

**Prerequisites:** You must have at least one account, containing at
least one bucket.

For each file stored in a Zenko bucket, you can view info, manipulate
tags and metadata, download the file to your local machine, or delete
the file from the bucket.

To access these operations:

#. Click **Browser** in the navigation pane.
#. Double-click the bucket you want to access.

   -  If the bucket is empty, Zenko asks you to **Drag and Drop
      Objects**:

      Clicking the Upload Objects button takes you to your local
      machine’s file system to pick files to upgrade. Clicking **skip**
      takes you to the empty bucket.

   -  Otherwise, the Multicloud Browser displays the bucket’s contents:

For each file, you can Download_, `View Info`_, or Delete_.
