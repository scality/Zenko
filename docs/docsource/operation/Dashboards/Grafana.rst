Grafana
=======

Grafana provides a “dashboard of dashboards” that offers deep insight
into ongoing operations. Installing the Zenko stack gives you access to
an “application-level” Grafana, which provides information about
CloudServer operations. Installing Zenko with MetalK8s also provides
access to “platform-level” Grafana, which provides information about
cluster operations.

Both require some setup, detailed in the installation guide, which ships
with the Zenko repository.

Application-Level Grafana
-------------------------

Deployed with all Zenko instances, application-level Grafana provides
insight into CloudServer operation.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operating application-level Grafana requires modifications to
options.yaml, and may require further configurations.

To enable application-level Grafana: 

1. Open the options.yaml file for editing. Though it may be located
   anywhere in your Zenko directory, if you followed the installation
   instructions closely, you will find it at 
   Zenko/kubernetes/zenko/options.yaml.

2. Add the following block to options.yaml:
   
   ::

     grafana:
       ingress:
         enabled: true
         hosts:
           - grafana.local
         tls:
           - secretName: zenko-tls
             hosts:
               - grafana.local
       adminUser: admin
       adminPassword: strongpassword
 
   .. important::

      Storing passwords in a plain text configuration file is not a best
      security practice. For higher security deployment, either allow Grafana
      to set its own passwords or have password secrets managed by a
      credentials management service, such as an LDAP secrets manager. This
      requires adding an LDAP configuration block to options.yaml, which exceeds
      scope for this documentation. **If you allow Grafana to set its own
      credentials using the default configuration, the Grafana credentials will
      be overwritten on every Helm upgrade command.**

3. Upgrade Zenko. From Zenko/kubernetes/zenko, enter:

   :: 

      $ helm upgrade my-zenko -f options.yaml .

4. If you did not configure the adminUser and adminPassword parameters in the
   previous step, Helm wipes the old Grafana instance and creates a new one.
   Grafana generates new admin credentials automatically. The default login is
   “admin.” To obtain the admin password from such a "default" installation, 
   run the following command from the command line, substituting the name of
   your Zenko instance for ``<my-zenko>``:

   ::

      $ echo $(kubectl get secret <my-zenko>-grafana -o "jsonpath={.data['admin-password']}" | base64 --decode)

Operation
~~~~~~~~~

Once your system and server are properly configured, access
application-level Grafana at http://grafana.local/login.

1. The Grafana login page displays:

   |image0|

   Enter the admin identity and the admin password as described in the 
   previous section.

2. The Grafana dashboard displays:

   |image1|

   From the Home Dashboard, you can **Add Users**, **Install apps and
   plugins**, or click through to the Cloudserver dashboard.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**You don’t see the Grafana login page**

Possible reasons:

-  Connectivity

   Make sure your browser can access and resolve the IP address
   (i.e., that you’re in the same network/VPN as your cluster), that
   :ref:`kubectl proxy is running<kubectl_proxy>` between your local
   machine and the server, and that the server’s Ingress controller is
   configured and running.

-  Grafana server is not set in /etc/hosts/

   In a managed namespace, the paths to zenko.local and grafana.local
   should resolve successfully without changes to /etc/hosts in the 
   local machine. However, in test environments, this resolution may not
   be provided.  Check that your local machine has the correct server IP
   address set in /etc/hosts (c:\\windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts
   for Windows machines). If not, add the following line to /etc/hosts, 
   substituting the IP address for the cluster on which you are operating
   Zenko and Grafana:
   
   ::

      10.1.1.1     zenko.local grafana.local

-  Ingress is not set.

   Run:

   ::

       $ helm upgrade <my-zenko> /path/to/zenko\
       --set grafana.ingress.enabled=true\
       --set grafana.ingress.hosts[0]=grafana.local

   This command may rewrite your Grafana credentials. See the note above.

-  Grafana is not running on the server: 

   ::

       $ kubectl get pods | grep grafana

**Your admin password is rejected**

#. If you’re sure you have entered the admin password correctly (as
   produced by the echo command above), run:

   ::

       $ kubectl get pods | grep grafana

       my-zenko-grafana-5dbf57f648-wbnkg               3/3       Running   0          7m

#. Copy the first part of the result and restart Grafana on the server
   with: 

   ::

       $ kubectl delete pod my-zenko-grafana-5dbf57f648-wbnkg

   Your particular running instance will, of course, have a different
   working name and hashes.

#. Give Kubernetes a minute or so to bring the Grafana pod back up.

#. When ``kubectl get pods`` shows the new Grafana instance running and
   stable, retry the login.
