  Scenario Outline: Configure bucket notifications for events
    Given a "<versioningConfiguration>" bucket
    And one notification destination
    When i subscribe to "<notificationType>" notifications for destination <destination>
    Then notifications should be enabled for "<notificationType>" event in destination <destination>

    Examples:
      | versioningConfiguration |                     notificationType | destination |
      |           Non versioned |                   s3:ObjectCreated:* |           0 |

  Scenario Outline: Recieve notification in multiple destinations
    Given a "<versioningConfiguration>" bucket
    And two notification destinations
    When i subscribe to "<subscribedNotificationType>" notifications for destination <destination>
    And i subscribe to "<subscribedNotificationTypeSec>" notifications for destination <destinationSec>
    And a "<triggeredNotif>" event is triggered "<enable>" "<filterType>"
    Then i should "<shouldReceive>" a notification for "<triggeredNotif>" event in destination <destination>
    And i should "<shouldReceiveSec>" a notification for "<triggeredNotif>" event in destination <destinationSec>

    Examples:
    | versioningConfiguration | subscribedNotificationType | subscribedNotificationTypeSec |             triggeredNotif |  enable | filterType | shouldReceive | shouldReceiveSec | destination | destinationSec |
    |           Non versioned |       s3:ObjectCreated:Put |          s3:ObjectCreated:Put |       s3:ObjectCreated:Put | without |     filter |       receive |          receive |           0 |              1 |
    |           Non versioned |       s3:ObjectCreated:Put |         s3:ObjectCreated:Copy |       s3:ObjectCreated:Put | without |     filter |       receive |      not receive |           0 |              1 |
