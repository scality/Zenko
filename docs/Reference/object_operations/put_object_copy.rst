.. _PUT Object - Copy:

PUT Object - Copy
=================

An implementation of the PUT operation, PUT Object - Copy creates a copy
of an object that is already stored. On internal data backends,
performing a PUT copy operation is the same as performing GET and then
PUT. On external cloud data backends, data is directly copied to the
designated backend. Adding the ``x-amz-copysource`` request header
causes the PUT operation to copy the source object into the destination
bucket.

By default, ``x-amz-copy-source`` identifies the current version of an
object to copy. To copy a different version, use the
``versionId``\ subresource.

When copying an object, it is possible to preserve most of the metadata
(default behavior) or specify new metadata with the
``x-amz-metadata-directive`` header. In the case of copying an object to
a specific location constraint, the metadata directive must be set to
REPLACE and the location constraint header specified. Otherwise, the
default location for the object copied is the location constraint of the
destination bucket.

The ACL, however, is not preserved and is set to private for the user
making the request if no other ACL preference is sent with the request.

All copy requests must be authenticated and cannot contain a message
body. Additionally, READ access is required for the source object, and
WRITE access is required for the destination bucket.

To copy an object only under certain conditions, such as whether the
ETag matches or whether the object was modified before or after a
specified date, use the request headers
x-amz-copy-source-if-match,x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match,x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since,
or x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since.

.. warning::

  When using v4 Authentication all headers prefixed with x-amz- must be
  signed, including x-amz-copy-source.

The source object being copied can be encrypted or unencrypted and the
destination object can be stored encrypted or unencrypted. If bucket
encryption is activated on the source bucket, the source object will
remain encrypted in its original location. If bucket encryption is
activated on the destination bucket, the destination object will be
encrypted. If bucket encryption is not activated on the destination
bucket, the object copy will be stored unencrypted

If the copy is successful, a response will generate that contains
information about the copied object.

AccessÂ Permissions
------------------

When copying an object, it is possible to specify the accounts or groups
that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are
two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:

-  Specify a canned ACL using the x-amz-acl request header.
-  Specify access permissions explicitly using thex-amz-grant-read,
   x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and
   x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These headers map to the set of
   permissions Zenko Enterprise supports in an ACL.

.. note::

  Access permissions can be explicitly specified or they can be enacted
  via a canned ACL. Both methods, however, cannot be deployed at the same
  time.

Requests
--------

**Request Syntax**

The Request Syntax that follows is for sending the ACL in the request
body. If headers are used to specify the permissions for the object, the
ACL cannot be sent in the request body (refer to :ref:`Common Request Headers` for a list of available headers).

.. code::

   PUT /destinationObject HTTP/1.1
   Host: destinationBucket.s3.amazonaws.com
   x-amz-copy-source: /source_bucket/sourceObject
   x-amz-metadata-directive: metadata_directive
   x-amz-copy-source-if-match: etag
   x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match: etag
   x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since: time_stamp
   x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since: time_stamp
   <request metadata>
   Authorization: {{authorizationString}}
   Date: date

.. note::

  The syntax shows only a representative sample of the possible request
  headers. For a complete list, refer to :ref:`Common Request Headers`.

**Request Parameters**

The PUT Object - Copy operation does not use Request Parameters.

**Request Headers**

The PUT Object - Copy operation can use a number of optional request
headers in addition to those that are common to all operations (refer to
:ref:`Common Request Headers`).

Note the following additional considerations about the preceding request
headers:

-  Consideration 1: If both of thex-amz-copy-source-if-match and
   x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since headers are present in the
   request as follows, Zenko Enterprise returns 200 OK and copies the data:

   .. code::

      x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true, and;
      x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false;

-  Consideration 2: If both of the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and
   x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since headers are present in the
   request as follows, Zenko Enterprise returns a 412 Precondition Failed response code:

   .. code::

      x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false, and;
      x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true

Additionally, the following access control-related (ACL)Â headers can be
used with the PUT Object - Copy operation. By default, all objects are
private; only the owner has full access control. When adding a new
object, it is possible to grant permissions to individual AWS accounts
or predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then
added to the Access Control List (ACL) on the object. For more
information, refer to :ref:`ACL (Access Control List)`.

*Specifying a Canned ACL*

Zenko Enterprise supports a set of predefined ACLs, each of which has a predefined set of
grantees and permissions.

To grant access permissions by specifying canned ACLs, use the x-amz-acl
header and specify the canned ACL name as its value.

.. note::

  Other access control specific headers cannot be used when the x-amz-acl
  header is in use.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

*Explicitly Specifying Grantee Access Permissions*

A set of headers is available for explicitly granting access permissions
to specific Zenko Enterprise accounts or groups.

.. note::

  Each of the x-amz-grant-permission headers maps to specific permissions
  the Zenko Enterprise supports in an ACL. Please also note that the use of any of these
  ACL-specific headers negates the use of the x-amz-acl header to set a
  canned ACL.

For each header, the value is a comma-separated list of one or more
grantees. Each grantee is specified as a ``type=value`` pair, where the
type can be one any one of the following:

-  ``emailAddress`` (if value specified is the email address of an
   account)
-  ``id`` (if value specified is the canonical user ID of an account)
-  ``uri`` (if granting permission to a predefined group)

For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants list objects
permission to two accounts identified by their email addresses:

.. code::

   x-amz-grant-read:  emailAddress="xyz@scality.com", emailAddress="abc@scality.com"

   Host: {{bucketName}}.s3.scality.com
   Date: Wed, 21 Sep 2016 18:18:00 GMT
   x-amz-copy-source: /{{bucketName}}/my-pdf-document.pdf
   Authorization: {{authorizationString}}

*Response Sample*

.. code::

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK

   </CopyObjectResult>

x-amz-version-id returns the version ID of the object in the destination
bucket, and x-amz-copy-source-version-id returns the version ID of the
source object.

**Copying a Specified Version of an Object**

The request sample copies a pdf file with a specified version ID and
copies it into the bucket {{bucketname}} and gives it a different key
name.

*Request Sample*

.. code::

   PUT /my-document.pdf HTTP/1.1
   Host: {{bucketName}}.s3.scality.com
   Date: Wed, 21 Sep 2016 18:18:00 GMT

   Authorization: {{authorizationString}}

*Response Sample: Copying a Versioned Object into a Version-Enabled Bucket*

The response sample shows that an object was copied into a target bucket
where Versioning is enabled.

   </CopyObjectResult>

*Response Sample: Copying a Versioned Object into a Version-Suspended Bucket*

The response sample shows that an object was copied into a target bucket
where versioning is suspended. Note that the response header
x-amz-version-id does not appear.

   </CopyObjectResult>

**Copying from an Unencrypted Object to an Object Encrypted with Server-Side Encryption, Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys**

The request sample specifies the HTTP PUT header to copy an unencrypted
object to an object encrypted with server-side encryption with
customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C).
