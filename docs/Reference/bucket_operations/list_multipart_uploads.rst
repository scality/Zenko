.. _List Multipart Uploads:

List Multipart Uploads
======================

The List Multipart Uploads operation catalogs in-progress multipart
uploads (multipart uploads that have been initiated via the Initiate
Multipart Upload request, but that have not yet been completed or
aborted).

List Multipart Uploads returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads in the
response (which is also the default setting for uploads a response can
include, adjustable via the max-uploads request parameter in the
response). If additional multipart uploads satisfy the list criteria,
the response returns an IsTruncated element with the value of ``true``.
To list the additional multipart uploads, use the key-marker and
upload-id-marker Request Parameters.

In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If the application has
initiated more than one multipart upload using the same object key, then
uploads in the response are first sorted by key. Additionally, uploads
are sorted in ascending order within each key by the upload initiation
time.

Requests
--------

**Request Syntax**

.. code::

   GET /?uploads HTTP/1.1
   Host: {{BucketName}}.{{StorageService}}.com
   Date: {{date}}
   Authorization: {{authorizationString}}

**Request Parameters**

The List Multipart Uploads operationâ€™s implementation of GET uses
certain parameters to return a subset of the ongoing multipart uploads
in a bucket.

**Request Headers**

Implementation of the List Multipart Uploads operation uses only request
headers that are common to all operations (refer to :ref:`Common Request
Headers`).

**Request Elements**

The List Multipart Uploads operation does not use request elements.

Responses
---------

**Response Headers**

The List Multipart Uploads uses only the common response headers
supported by Zenko Enterprise (refer to :ref:`Common Response Headers`).

**Response Elements**

The List Multipart Uploads operation can return the following

**List Multipart Uploads**

*Request Sample*

The request sample lists three multipart uploads, specifying the
max-uploads request parameter to set the maximum number of multipart
uploads to return in the response body.

.. code::

   GET /?uploads&amp;max-uploads=3 HTTP/1.1
   Host:  example-bucket.{{StorageService}}.com
   Date: Mon, 1 Nov 2010 20:34:56 GMT
   Authorization: {{authorizationString}}

*Response Sample*

The request sample indicates that the multipart upload list was
truncated and provides the NextKeyMarker and the NextUploadIdMarker
elements. These values are specified in subsequent requests to read the
next set of multipart uploads. That is, send a subsequent request
specifying ``key-marker=my-movie2.m2ts`` (value of the NextKeyMarker
element) and
``upload-id-marker=YW55IGlkZWEgd2h5IGVsdmluZydzIHVwbG9hZCBmYWlsZWQ``
(value of the NextUploadIdMarker).

The sample response also shows a case of two multipart uploads in
progress with the same key (``my-movie.m2ts``). That is, the response
shows two uploads with the same key. This response shows the uploads
sorted by key, and within each key the uploads are sorted in ascending
order by the time the multipart upload was initiated.

   </ListMultipartUploadsResult>

**Using the Delimiter and the Prefix Parameters**

Assume a multipart upload is in progress for the following keys in a
``example-bucket``.

-  greatshot.raw
-  photographs/2006/January/greatshot.raw
-  photographs/2006/February/greatshot.raw
-  photographs/2006/March/greatshot.raw
-  video_content/2006/March/greatvideo.raw

*Request Sample: Request Specifies delimiter Parameter*

The sample list multipart upload request specifies the delimiter
parameter with value "/".

.. code::

   GET /?uploads&amp;delimiter=/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: example-bucket.s3.scality.com
   Date: Mon, 1 Nov 2010 20:34:56 GMT
   Authorization: {{authorizationString}}

*Response Sample*

The response sample lists multipart uploads on the specified bucket,
``example-bucket``.

The response returns multipart upload for the greatshot.raw key in an
Upload element. As all the other keys contain the specified delimiter,
however, a distinct substringâ€”from the beginning of the key to the first
occurence of the delimiter, from each of the keysâ€”is returned in a
CommonPrefixes element. The key substrings, ``photographs/`` and
``video_content/``, in the CommonPrefixes element indicate that there
are one or more in-progress multipart uploads with these key prefixes.

This is a useful scenario if key prefixes are used for objects for the
purpose of creating a logical folder like structure. In this case you
can interpret the result as the folders ``photographs/`` and
``video_content/`` have one or more multipart uploads in progress. In
such a case the results can be interpreted, as the folders
``photographs/`` and ``video_content/`` have one or more multipart
uploads in progress.

     <CommonPrefixes>
       <Prefix>videos/</Prefix>
     </CommonPrefixes>
     </ListMultipartUploadsResult>

**Request Sample: Specified delimiter Parameter and Added prefix Parameter**

In addition to the delimiterparameter, results can be filtered by adding
a prefix parameter.

.. code::

   GET /?uploads&amp;delimiter=/&amp;prefix=photographs/2006/ HTTP/1.1
   Host: example-bucket.s3.scalityaws.com
   Date: Mon, 1 Nov 2010 20:34:56 GMT
   Authorization: authorization string

*Response Sample*

In this case the response will include only multipart uploads for keys
that start with the specified prefix. The value returned in the
CommonPrefixes element is a substring from the beginning of the key to
the first occurrence of the specified delimiter after the prefix.

.. code::

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <ListMultipartUploadsResult xmlns="http://s3.scality.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
     <Bucket>example-bucket</Bucket>
     <KeyMarker/>
     <UploadIdMarker/>
     <NextKeyMarker/>
     <NextUploadIdMarker/>
     <Delimiter>/</Delimiter>
     <Prefix>photos/2006/</Prefix>
     <MaxUploads>1000</MaxUploads>
     <IsTruncated>false</IsTruncated>
     <CommonPrefixes>
       <Prefix>photos/2006/February/</Prefix>
     </CommonPrefixes>
     <CommonPrefixes>
       <Prefix>photos/2006/January/</Prefix>
     </CommonPrefixes>
     <CommonPrefixes>
       <Prefix>photos/2006/March/</Prefix>
     </CommonPrefixes>
   </ListMultipartUploadsResult>
