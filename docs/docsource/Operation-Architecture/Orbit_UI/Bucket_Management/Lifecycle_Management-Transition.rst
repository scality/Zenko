Object Lifecycle Management: Transition
=======================================

**Prerequisite:** You must have established a bucket to transition data from,
and another bucket to send transitioned data to.

To establish a lifecycle transition rule:

#. From anywhere in Orbit, click the **WORKFLOWS > Bucket
   Lifecycle** tab in the left navbar.

   .. image:: ../../Resources/Images/Orbit_Screencaps/Orbit_lifecycle_select.png
      :scale: 80%

#. The **Bucket Lifecycle** screen displays.

#. Choose a bucket and pick **Add New Rule > Transition**

   .. image:: ../../Resources/Images/Orbit_Screencaps/Orbit_lifecycle_add_new_rule.png
      :scale: 75 %
      :align: center

#. The **Add New Transition Rule** dialog displays:

   .. image:: ../../Resources/Images/Orbit_Screencaps/Orbit_lifecycle_add_transition_rule.png
      :scale: 75 %
      :align: center

   You may name a directory or subdirectory to which the rule applies. Enter
   a time span after the object's current version was last modified and specify
   a location to which it shall be moved. You can also add a comment about the
   transition rule.

   Click **Save**.

#. The new rule is displayed:

   .. image:: ../../Resources/Images/Orbit_Screencaps/Orbit_lifecycle_transition_rule_success.png
      :align: center

   Zenko will enforce these rules on this bucket. If replication is configured, 
   any change of state to objects in this bucket can be replicated to buckets 
   on other clouds.
