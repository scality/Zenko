    Scenario Outline: PRA
    Given a "<versioningConfiguration>" bucket
    And a transition workflow to "e2e-cold" location
    And <objectCount> objects "obj" of size <objectSize> bytes
    Then object "obj-1" should be "transitioned" and have the storage class "e2e-cold"
    And object "obj-2" should be "transitioned" and have the storage class "e2e-cold"
    And dmf volume should contain <objectCount> objects
    Given a DR installed

    Examples:
    | versioningConfiguration | objectCount | objectSize |
    |           Non versioned |           2 |        100 |
    |               Versioned |           2 |        100 |
    |               Suspended |           2 |        100 |
