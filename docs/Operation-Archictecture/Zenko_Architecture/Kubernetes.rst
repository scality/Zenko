Kubernetes
==========

Kubernetes is the essential manager for Zenko cloud instances, spawning
and destroying containerized services, load balancing, and managing
failover for a robust, highly available service.

Zenko operates with Kubernetes engines provided by all major cloud
storage providers, including Amazon Elastic Container Service for
Kubernetes (EKS), Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Google
Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Additionally, Scality provides MetalK8s, an
open-source Kubernetes engine you can deploy on a cluster to provide
Kubernetes service to maintain independence from cloud storage
providers.
