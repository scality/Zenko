.. _`DELETE Object`:

DELETE Object
=============

The DELETE Object operation removes the null version (if there is one)
of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current
version of the object. If there isnâ€™t a null version, Zenko does not remove
any objects.

Only the bucket owner can remove a specific version, using the versionId
subresource, whichpermanently deletes the version. If the object deleted
is a delete marker, Zenko sets the response header x-amz-delete-marker to
true.
