Supported Clouds
----------------

Zenko supports multiple-cloud storage operations natively using the Amazon
Simple Storage Service (S3) protocol. Once a site has been integrated to
the S3 protocol, Zenko handles S3 API calls and can replicate stored data at
the site level to the following supported private and public clouds:

-  Amazon S3-based public clouds:

   -  Amazon Simple Storage Service
   -  DigitalOcean Spaces
   -  Wasabi

-  Amazon-S3-based private clouds:

   - Scality RING S3 Connector
   - Red Hat Ceph RADOS Gateway

-  Other public clouds:

   - Google Cloud Storage
   - Microsoft Azure Storage

Other cloud storage services are being validated.
