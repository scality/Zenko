.. _Setting Up a Cluster:

Setting Up a Cluster
====================

Most of the complexity of installing Zenko on a cluster involves deploying the
cluster istelf. Scality supports MetalK8s_, an open source Kubernetes engine
optimized for the Zenko use case, to manage cluster operations
dynamically. While running Zenko on a single machine is desirable for certain
use cases, a clustered operating environment is required for high-availability
deployments, and even on single-node deployments, Kubernetes management is a
necessity.

If you can set up a Kubernetes cluster on your own, review the :ref:`General
Cluster Requirements` and skip to :ref:`Install_Zenko`. Otherwise, download `the
latest stable version of MetalK8s
<https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/releases>`_ and follow its instructions to
establish a working Kubernetes instance on your cluster. Though Zenko is built
to run on any Kubernetes, Scality only supports clusters built on MetalK8s.

.. note: 

   Zenko 1.1 and later are not compatible with Kubernetes instances before
   version |min_kubernetes|. Scality recommends MetalK8s 2.4 or later, which
   satisfies this requirement.

The following section describes general cluster requirements that have been
tested on MetalK8s. Because MetalK8s is designed to operate without support from
public cloud resources, the following sizing requirements are assumed sufficient
for hosted cloud Kubernetes clusters, where such resources are available on
demand.

General Cluster Requirements
----------------------------

Setting up a high availability cluster requires at least three machines (these
can be VMs) running CentOS_ 7.4 or higher. The recommended mimimum for
high-availability Zenko production service is the Standard Architecture, a
five-node cluster with three masters/etcds. The Compact Architecture, a
three-node cluster configuration, is also supported. The cluster must have an
odd number of nodes to provide a quorum. You must have SSH access to these
machines and they must have SSH access to each other.

.. important::
   
   Three-node clusters can continue to operate without service disruption or
   data loss if one node fails. Five-node clusters can operate without
   disruption or loss if two nodes fail.

Each machine acting as a Kubernetes_ node must also have at least one disk
available to provision storage volumes.
